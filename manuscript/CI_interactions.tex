\section*{Introduction}

    % Present Salix data with holes as an example of uncertainty in data. Focus just on the white and grey, ignore uncertainty in the blacks


    Ecological networks-- which include antagonistic food webs and host-parasite networks as well as plant-pollinator and plant-frugivore mutualist networks --are usually considered to be static representations of the communities and interactions they describe. That is, whether the network is assembled based on aggregated data, a single intensive "snapshot" sample, or expert knowledge, interactions are assumed to occur at constant frequencies~\citep{Olesen2011a}. This assumption conflicts with known variation in interactions over time~\citep{Kitching1987,Olesen2011a} and space~\citep{Kitching1987,Baiser2012} and between individuals of a given species~\citep{Pires2011a,Fodrie2015,Novak2015}. Taking the variances in interaction frequencies into account would therefore represent a substantial increase in the realism of ecological networks as representations of ecological communities.


    Efforts to account for variance in interaction frequencies are complicated by the fact that not only interaction frequencies but network structure vary over space and time. Community composition and species abundances vary from site to site~\citep{Baiser2012} and over time within a site~\citep{Olesen2011a}. Moreover, interactions between species may change even if the participating species remain present at a site but do not co-occur temporally or are too rare to detect each other~\citep{Tylianakis2010}, or through changes to individual preferences~\citep{Fodrie2015}. Several researchers have pointed to the importance of sampling intensity for the assessment of network structure (e.g.,~\citealp{}). The acknowledgement that insufficient sampling effort limits our ability to describe variation in ecological networks has not, however, led to a quantitative framework to deal with the uncertainty of ecological interactions and of sampling.


    The main objective of this study is to develop analytical tools that could be used to better represent the uncertainty in the estimation of pairwise interaction probability. We start with the description of a new Bayesian approach to estimate ecological interactions and of a related R package. We first illustrate the framework with simple quantitative examples, followed by an assessment of the quality of an empirically-estimated plant-pollinator network. Next, we use the framework to provide analytical criteria for improving the sampling of rare interations. Finally, we discuss the implications of uncertainty in the estimation of pairwise interactions on the properties of ecological networks. Through these efforts, we demonstrate both the utility of our approach and the importance of acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in ecological networks.

\section*{Different uncertainties in computing a network}

THIS SECTIONS BUILDS ON THE SALIX DATA TO ILLUSTRATE THE GAPS THERE ARE IN THE METHOD. DESPITE THE INTENSITY OF THE SAMPLING, THERE ARE SEVERAL HOLES.



\section*{Why some interactions do not occur ?}

It is getting more and more common to represent interactions as probabilities. Some theoretical models of network structure propose to represent interactions with probabilities, for instance the minmum potential model introduces gaps in the feeding niche of predators (Allesina et al. 2008), while a gaussian probability function is used to represent the niche by Williams et al. (2010). Eklof et al. (2013) introduced variability as well in the computation of network dimensions, allowing the absence of interactions within the n-dimension niche of every species. Empirical investigation of trait-matching constraints often consider the occurrence of interactions as binomial process (e.g. Rohr et al. 2016). There are also ways to perform analysis of probabilistic networks, with almost all metrics having a probabilistic version (Poisot et al. 2015). But there is not yet consensus on what an interaction probability between a pair of species means, and this is definitely a problem when comes time to estimate the uncertainty of both pairwise interactions and entire networks. 

Starting from the problem described in the previous section, we consider that a pair of species have been observed $n$ times co-occurring at one location, and the number of times they interact is $k = 0$. We aim to evaluate the uncertainty of this interaction. What this is mean exactly ? We consider there are three nested level of uncertainty making this phenomenon a stochastic process :  

\textit{Interaction uncertainty} First, and most fundamentally, we do not know if these species have the appropriate characteristics to interact or not. We define the probability of an interaction $L$ as $P(L)=\lambda$. Obviously, because $k=0$, it is very likely they can not interact if provided enough time and there were no environmental constraint for this interaction to happen. But it is nonetheless possible the interaction is a rare phenomenon that has never been documented before. This source of uncertainty is the one documented by trait-matching models. It arises because every model is imperfect and lack information (i.e. traits) about the constraints on the interaction. In other words, with sufficient sampling and all information accessible, this interaction probability should either tend to 0 or to 1 and the uncertainty vanish.  

\textit{Process uncertainty} It could happen that the interaction is feasible, i.e. $L=1$, but that it does not occur at a given location or at a moment in time because there are local constraints preventing it to occur. We define the realization of the interaction process $X$ given an interaction is feasible as a stochastic process with associated probability $P(X|L)=\chi$. This phenomenon of interaction contingencies is usually not considered in network studies, but there is a rich literature in community ecology about the contingencies of interactions. We imagine for instance that an interaction between a gall and a parasitoid is not recorded at a location because it was the wrong time of the year and the gall has not yet formed (phenological constraints), because a late frost killed the larvae (an abiotic environmental constraint) , another parasitoid species competitively excluded the parasitoid species of interst (a biotic environmental constraint) or simply the parasitoid is too rare (an abundance constraint). 

\textit{Detection uncertainty} Lastly, measurement errors are always source of uncertainty in the observation of ecological processes. We define the detection of an interaction $D$, given an interaction is feasible and occurs in the local conditions, as a stochastic process with associated probability $P(D|X,L)=\delta$. Detection failure could happen for several reasons, for instance if the rearing of a parasitoid fails with inappropriate lab conditions or because of species mis-identification. Some source of detection error could be minimized with appropriate sampling effort ($\chi$ will converge to one with increasing number of collected galls), but other sources are often difficult to reduce (e.g. the occurrence of cryptic species might require molecular analysis for appropriate taxonomic identification).

\textit{What is an observation of "no interaction" ?} The combination of these three sources of uncertainty together leads to many potential explanations for the observation of an absence of interaction, but only the situation where $L = 0$ is a true absence therefore is relevant for the investigation of networks. While the observation of an interaction is straightforward to interpret, absence of interactions must be decomposed in different quantities. It is particularly important to rule out the situations where $D=0 \cup X = 1 \cup L=1$, i.e. the interaction occurred at the location but was not observed, and $D=1 \cup X = 0 \cup L =1$, the interaction would have been detected but did not occur. 

It is important to keep in mind that for network analysis, ecologists seek to measure the occurrence of true absences, which is the joint event $L=1\cup X=1 \cup \D=1$), but in reality they measure the marginal probability $P(L) = k/n$. 



\section*{Estimating detection and process uncertainty}




\section*{Maximum likelihood estimate and confidence interval of interaction probability}

Estimation of the detection and process uncertainties could be tedious, if not infeasible in some instances. As a consequence, for now, we will focus on the estimate of the interaction probability $\lambda$, assuming that both the detection and process probabilities, $\delta$ and $\chi$ respectively, are equal to 1. The occurrence of an interaction is a Bernoulli trial. Consequently, the number of success $k$ over $n$ trials will follow a binomial distribution: 
    
    \begin{equation}
      X \sim Bin(n,\lambda) ,
    \end{equation}

    \noindent and 

    \begin{equation}
       P(X = k|\lambda,n) = {n \choose k}\lambda^k(1-\lambda)^{n-k} . 
       \label{likelihood}
    \end{equation}

\noindent The parameter $\lambda$, the probability of observing an interaction over an infinite time interval and area, is the quantity we want to estimate from empirical data. The variance of a Bernoulli experiment is simply n$\lambda$(1-$\lambda$). It is important to remember this variance reports the variability of the number of success $k$ for $n$ trials, it is not the variance associated with the estimation of $\lambda$.

The maximal likelihood estimate of $\lambda$ is straightforward to find given $k$ and $n$. It is simply equal to:

    \begin{equation}
      \theta_{MLE} = \frac{k}{n}  .
      \label{theta_MLE}
    \end{equation}

It is possible to compute the confidence interval for this estimate using any of several methods, including the \emph{Wilson score interval}, the \emph{Clopper-Pearson interval}, and the \emph{Agresti-Coull Interval}. Finding this estimate is therefore quite straightforward, but it nonetheless has two drawbacks. First, $\lambda$ is a random variable with a given uncertainty and whose distribution is unknown, it is not a single point estimate. This means that even if $k = 0$ in a given sample, it does not implies necessarily that the two species will never interact. It means that no interaction is the most likely situation, but there is nonetheless a significant chance that the two species could interaction. In contrast with the situation where $k>0$, where we are sure that an interaction is feasible (in which case, the ratio $k/n$ is smaller than $n$ because of detection and process uncertainty), we are not sure that absence of interactions are caused by $L=0$. Second, and most importantly, the number of trials $n$ might be very low in many instances (and some pairs of species might even not be documented), and consequently the uncertainty in the estimation of $\lambda$ might be considerable. We illustrated at Fig. X how the estimate of $\lambda$ could vary with sampling size using the Clopper-Pearson interval. It shows that the 95\% confidence interval requires a signifcant amount of sampling in order to be sure that species are not interacting. 

The situation where $k = 0$ is also problematic because we have very few information to estimate $\lambda$, in particular when $n$ is also small. We therefore propose a Bayesian approach to solve this problem, building on two relevant features of such statistics : posterior distribution of parameter estimates and usage of prior information. 

 \section*{Bayesian approach to infer interaction probabilities}

    \subsection*{Posterior distribution of the interaction probability}

  We here adopt a Bayesian approach to estimate the distribution of the parameter $\theta$. According to Bayes principle, the posterior distribution of $\theta$ is:

  \begin{equation}
    \underbrace{P(\theta|X,n)}_{Posterior} = \frac{\overbrace{P(X|\theta,n)}^{Likelihood}\overbrace{P(\theta)}^{Prior}}{\underbrace{P(X|N)}_{Normalizer}} .
    \label{posterior}
  \end{equation}

  According to the above description, the likelihood is simply the binomial distribution (Eq.~\ref{likelihood}). Since $\theta$ is a probability it is bounded between 0 and 1 and consequently the most appropriate prior distribution is the beta:

    \begin{equation}
      \theta \sim Beta(\alpha,\beta) , \label{prior}
    \end{equation}

  \noindent which has two shape parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 

 In some cases it can be complicated to compute the normalizer, but fortunately in our case it exists an analytical solution. The beta-binomial distribution is a conjugate distribution of the binomial distribution. This allows us to analytically compute the posterior distribution of a binomial model with a beta prior distribution. We can re-write the posterior distribution of $\theta$ as:

  \begin{equation}
    P(\theta|k,n) = \frac{\theta^{\alpha+k-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta+n-k-1}}{B(\alpha+k,\beta+n-k)} , \label{posterior}
  \end{equation}

  \noindent where the function $B$ is the beta function:

  \begin{equation}
    Beta(\alpha+k,\beta+n-k) = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+k)\Gamma(\beta+n-k)}{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta+n)} . \label{betafunction}
  \end{equation}

  The posterior distribution of $\theta$ therefore follows the beta distribution with new parameters $\alpha'= \alpha+k$ and $\beta'=\beta+n-k$. The weight of the prior on the posterior distribution is understood from these definition of the parameters: the difference between the posterior and the prior will increase with $k$ and $n-k$. When plotted, we find the shape of the distribution gets narrower with $k$ and $n$ (see Fig X). 
%
%  The posterior distribution of $\theta$ could be computed with R with the following command:
%
%
%  \vspace{12pt}
%  \noindent\emph{dbeta(x = theta, shape1 = alpha+k, shape1 = beta+n-k)}
%  \vspace{12pt}

  \subsection*{Moments and other properties}

  The fact that the posterior distribution of $\theta$ follows a beta distribution makes it straightforward to compute moments and other properties. 

  The \textbf{average} of $\theta$ is: 
      \begin{equation}
        \bar{\theta} = \frac{\alpha+k}{\alpha+\beta+n} ,
        \label{mean}
      \end{equation}

    and its \textbf{variance} is:  
      \begin{equation}
        Var(\theta|k) = \frac{(\alpha + k)(\beta + n - k)}{(\alpha + \beta + n)^{2}(\alpha + \beta + n +1)}
        \label{variance}
      \end{equation}

    The \textbf{mode} of the distribution is:
      \begin{equation}
        \hat{\theta} = \frac{\alpha + k - 1}{\alpha + \beta + n - 2} .
        \label{mode}
      \end{equation}

  \subsection*{The prior distribution}    
  Parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ determine the shape of the prior distribution, which follows a beta distribution. These are called hyper parameters. Below we identify four ways to formulate the prior distribution of $\theta$. 

    \subsubsection*{Uninformative prior}
      
      In absence of any external information, an uniformative prior is the most conservative 
      hypothesis for the distribution of $\theta$. The beta distribution is in this case 
      a uniform distribution  for $Beta(\alpha=1,\beta=1)$. 

    \subsubsection*{Distribution of connectance}
      
      In the literature of ecological networks there is a solid collection of data for which know network connectance, and we can thereby define the connectance distribution. Connectance is measured as $C = L/S^2$, where $L$ is the number of interactions and $S$ is the number of species. It measures the filling of an interaction matrix and thereby expresses the average probability that any two species interact with each other. If we know only the mean $\overline{C}$ and the variance $\sigma_C^2$ of the distribution of $C$, then the beta parameters could be computed as follows using the method of moments:

  \begin{equation}
    \alpha = \overline{C}(\frac{\overline{C}(1-\overline{C})}{\sigma_C^2}-1) ,
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
    \beta = (1-\overline{C})(\frac{\overline{C}(1-\overline{C})}{\sigma_C^2}-1) .
  \end{equation}
  
%  It is also possible to compute maximum likelihood estimates for a sample of the distribution of $C$.
%  
%   The following piece of R code provides an example: 
%
%  \vspace{12pt}
%  \noindent\emph{
%    library(MASS)\\
%    pars = fitdistr(x = vecC, "beta", start = list(shape1 = 1, shape2 = 1))\$estimate
%  }
%  \vspace{12pt}
%
%
%  Where $vecC$ is a vector of known connectances for a set of networks. 


  \subsubsection*{Degree distribution for the species in the network}.
%
The degree of a node in a network is defined as the number of interactions it has to other nodes. The degree distribution of a network is then the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network. Connectance is an average property for a complete given network, and it represents the expected
degree (expected number of interactions per species) standardized by the number of species in the network. The standardized degree could therefore be interpreted as an interaction probability. It is consequently possible to
use the degree distribution to inform the prior distribution. The degree distribution could
come from several networks, from a similar network (e.g. a known network at slightly different location) or from the network of interest if interaction probabilities for some species are already documented. The latter approach allows us to apply information from known, abundant species to the rarest species for which interactions are less
frequently documented. The procedure for the estimation of the hyper parameters follows
the same approach as described above for connectance except that each
measurement is at the individual species level instead of the network level.

  \subsubsection*{Trait-matching function}. 
  It is possible to estimate the probability of interaction between a pair of species if there is knowledge of their traits and some functions relating trait matching to interaction probability (Morales-Castilla2015). There are several techniques available to perform this inferrence of interaction probability (REFS). Note that in this case the prior might not be beta distribution and numerical methods might be required to compute the posterior distribution.  

\section*{A quantitative example}
%Perhaps we want to also have a trait matching example in addition to the degree distribution example below?
The framework can be illustrated with a simple quantiative example. Suppose we have $n = 10$ observations of co-occurrence between speices $i$ and species $j$ in a given time interval and area, and $X = 2$ observations of interactions. The maximum likelihood estimate of the interaction probability is simply $\theta_{MLE} = 2/10 = 0.2$. 
% We should probabaly have a value  on the interaction probablitity that differs from the average of the degree distrbution
 Now consider we know that species $i$ is known to interact with 10 other species, which have the following standardized degrees:

\vspace{12pt}
\noindent\emph{
    degree = c(0.66, 0.09, 0.06, 0.08, 0.04, 0.30, 0.06, 0.38, 0.03, 0.19)
    }.
  \vspace{12pt}

Using these standardized degrees to inform our prior expectation of the 
distribution of interaction probabilities and the R code from the 
connectance example, we obtain prior parameters $\alpha$=0.9034876 
and $\beta$=3.6623995. Using these priors in equations~\ref{mean} 
and~\ref{variance} above, we find an average interaction probability of 0.1993348 and a variance of 0.01025322 [[Different from Dom's values]].
% n=number of observed co-occurances.
The average interaction probability is 0.2163971 and the variance is 0.02353319. The hyper parameters are computed according to the following script, using the function \emph{fitdistr} from the R~\citep{R} package MASS~\citep{MASS}, yielding:

\vspace{12pt}
\noindent\emph{    pars = fitdistr(x = degree, "beta", start = list(shape1 = 1, shape2 = 1),lower=c(0,0))\$estimate }.
  \vspace{12pt}

The lower bound of (0,0) for the two parameters of the Beta distribution prevents the function from attempting to fit invalid (negative) parameter estimations.

The average of the distribution is computed as follows:

  \vspace{12pt}
\noindent
\emph{
    \noindent n = 10
    \\\noindent k = 2
    \\\noindent alpha\_prime = alpha + k
    \\\noindent beta\_prime = beta + n - k
    \\\noindent mean\_theta = alpha\_prime/(alpha\_prime+beta\_prime)
},
  \vspace{12pt}


which yields a value $E[\theta]=0.2057651$ [[I get 0.1993348]]. And the variance:

  \vspace{12pt}
\noindent\emph{alpha\_prime$\times$ beta\_prime\/(alpha\_prime+beta\_prime)$^2$\/(alpha\_prime+beta\_prime+1)},
  \vspace{12pt}


which yiealds a value $var[\theta] = 0.009579623$. [[I get 0.01025322]]

The credible interval is not symmetric around the mean since the distribution is bounded between 0 and 1 and is not symmetric. In this case, a 95\% credible interval for the mean of theta is (0.0448479, 0.4308686) and can be computed using the quantile function \emph{qbeta}:

  \vspace{12pt}
\noindent\emph{
    \noindent lowCI = qbeta(p = 0.025, shape1 = alpha\_prime, shape2 = beta\_prime)
    \\\noindent highCI = qbeta(p = 0.975, shape1 = alpha\_prime, shape2 = beta\_prime)}.
  \vspace{12pt}

Now, consider the case where the two species have never been observed interacting across $n$ trials. The question is then ``what is the probability these two species do not interact''? Since it is not possible to prove that the two species could never interact, given the framework above we must fix a threshold below which we consider that there is no interaction. We call this threshold probability $\theta*$. We then use the cumulative distribution function to estimate $P(\theta<\theta*|X=0,n)$. The following script illustrates this probability for an increasing number of trials and $\theta*$=0.1:

  \vspace{12pt}
\noindent\emph{
    \noindent n = seq(0,100,1)
    \\\noindent X = 0
    \\\noindent theta\_star = 0.1
    \\\noindent cdf = pbeta(theta\_star, shape1 = alpha+X, shape2 = beta+n-X)
    \\\noindent plot(n,cdf, type = "l", xlab = "n", ylab = "Cumulative distribution")
    \\\noindent abline(h = 0.95,lty = 3)}.
  \vspace{12pt}

The exercise exemplified above yields a surprising result: it requires \textgreater30 [[or 23??]] observations of no interactions to be 95\% sure that the interaction probability is smaller than 0.1. Note the special case where there is no observation of the two species co-occurring and failing to interact, $n = 0$. In this situation, the posterior distribution converges to the prior distribution. 


\section*{Scaling up uncertainty from pairwise interactions to networks}






\section*{Case study: estimating the uncertainty of a plant-herbivore network}

    \subsection*{Description of the data}

      \emph{Salix}-galler-parasitoid meta-network, here focusing on the smaller \emph{Salix}-galler network. The meta-network consists of interactions between 52? \emph{Salix} species and 222 species of gall-forming insects, sampled from 374 locations in Europe ranging from Sicily to the Arctic. In total, 4295 unique interactions were observed. Each of the 374 locations can be considered as a network in its own right, but here we consider each network as an independent sample from which to build the meta-network.


  \subsection*{Finding the maximum likelihood estimate}

      In a strict Bayesian framework, we wish to use a prior distribution that does not rely on any information from the study at hand. To that end, we use data from another well-described \emph{Salix} galler-parasitoid system (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1513633113). Note that this study used several genotypes of \emph{S. hookeriana} rather than different \emph{Salix} species. We estimated frequencies of  \emph{S. hookeriana} genotype-galler and galler-parasitoid interactions [[host-parasitoid still to-do]] based on the normalized degree of each species in each network component (see \emph{Appendix S1} for details and code).


      Using this prior distribution of galler-\emph{Salix} interaction frequencies, we can obtain parameters for the prior distribution of $\lambda$ in our dataset. Specifically, we obtain $\alpha$=2.807855, $\beta$=2.342815. We are then able to use these priors to estimate the posterior distriution of interaction probabilities given the additional information in our dataset.


    \subsection*{Computing the posterior distribution}

      [[add references to formulae]]

      For species where no co-occurances were observed, we can calculate the MLE estimates for the mean and variance of $\lambda_{ij}$ directly from this prior. These are:
      $\hat{\lambda_{ij}}$=0.5451437, var($\lambda$)=0.0481417.
      This is consistent with the prior data, where the average interaction probability based on the degree distributions of Salix genotypes and gallers was 0.541. [[What's the connectance of our dataset, of we call greys 0?]] This probability does, however, seem rather high for our dataset. This discrepancy may be because~\citep{Balbour2016} were considering genotypes of a single \emph{Salix} species and only four gallers from a single family rather than multiple \emph{Salix} species and galler families as is the case in our dataset.


      For a pair of species where some co-occurances were observed, we can update the prior distribution with these data. If we consider only pairs of species which were observed to co-occur but not to interact, $k_{ij}$ is always 0 and only $n_{ij}$ will vary between species pairs. Thus $\alpha'$=$\alpha$ and $\beta'$=$\beta + n$. At the most extreme case, for a pair of species which co-occurred at all 374 sites and was never observed to interact, our distribution would become:


      $\hat{\lambda_{ij}}$=7.405645 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$, var($\lambda_{ij}$)=1.938755 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$.
      
      With species $i$ and $j$ co-occurring at all 374 sites and never being observed to interact, the maximum likelihood expectation for the probability of an interaction $ij$ is very close to 0 and the variance about this estimate is very narrow. In most cases, however, species $i$ and $j$ did not co-occur at so many sites and our posterior mean and variance retain some influence of the prior.


      Realistic values for n when k=0, based on a sample of 20 random sites:
      n=1: 0.4565121 0.0403385
      n=2: 0.39267022 0.03335076
      n=3: 0.34449379 0.02770543
      n=4: 0.30684696 0.02324331


      [[Plot distribution of interaction probabilities at some reasonable values of n]]


  \subsection*{Computing the credible interval around a probability estimate}

      As well as obtaining posterior means and variances, it is possible to calculate a 95\% credible interval about the posterior mean. 


  \subsection*{How many samples are required to reach a minimal precision}


    - Have code for graphing or returning sample size set up.
    - Plot Increase in sample sizes with decreasing threshold, increasing confidence.




  [[What if we have only one site? Can we use the number of observations of a pair of species interacting with any partners as the number of times they co-occur, and the number of interactions within the pair as k? This will be sort-of valid for insects but not for plants when researchers camp out by plant individuals... ]]
