abstract = {Principal component analysis is central to the study of multivariate data. Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques it continues to be the subject of much research, ranging from new model- based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely versatile with applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this book was the first comprehensive text written solely on principal component analysis. The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three other books. His research interests are broad, but aspects of principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him busy for over 30 years.},

abstract = {Human-induced habitat destruction, overexploitation, introduction of alien species and climate change are causing species to go extinct at unprecedented rates, from local to global scales. There are growing concerns that these kinds of disturbances alter important functions of ecosystems. Our current understanding is that key parameters of a community (e.g. its functional diversity, species composition, and presence/absence of vulnerable species) reflect an ecological network's ability to resist or rebound from change in response to pressures and disturbances, such as species loss. If the food web structure is relatively simple, we can analyse the roles of different species interactions in determining how environmental impacts translate into species loss. However, when ecosystems harbour species-rich communities, as is the case in most natural systems, then the complex network of ecological interactions makes it a far more challenging task to perceive how species' functional roles influence the consequences of species loss. One approach to deal with such complexity is to focus on the functional traits of species in order to identify their respective roles: for instance, large species seem to be more susceptible to extinction than smaller species. Here, we introduce and analyse the marine food web from the high Antarctic Weddell Sea Shelf to illustrate the role of species traits in relation to network robustness of this complex food web. Our approach was threefold: firstly, we applied a new classification system to all species, grouping them by traits other than body size; secondly, we tested the relationship between body size and food web parameters within and across these groups and finally, we calculated food web robustness. We addressed questions regarding (i) patterns of species functional/trophic roles, (ii) relationships between species functional roles and body size and (iii) the role of species body size in terms of network robustness. Our results show that when analyzing relationships between trophic structure, body size and network structure, the diversity of predatory species types needs to be considered in future studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many studies have aimed to understand food webs by investigating components such as trophic links (one consumer taxon eats one resource taxon), tritrophic interactions (one consumer eats an intermediate taxon, which eats a resource), or longer chains of links. We show here that none of these components (links, tritrophic interactions, and longer chains), individually or as an ensemble, accounts fully for the properties of the next higher level of organization. As a cell is more than its molecules, as an organ is more than its cells, and as an organism is more than its organs, in a food web, new structure emerges at every organizational level up to and including the whole web. We demonstrate the emergence of properties at progressively higher levels of structure by using all of the directly observed, appropriately organized, publicly available food web datasets with relatively complete trophic link data and with average body mass and population density data for each taxon. There are only three such webs, those of Tuesday Lake, Michigan, in 1984 and 1986, and Ythan Estuary, Scotland. We make the data freely available online with this report. Differences in web patterns between Tuesday Lake and Ythan Estuary, and similarities of Tuesday Lake in 1984 and 1986 despite 50{\%} turnover of species, suggest that the patterns we describe respond to major differences between ecosystem types.},

abstract = {Species interactions, ranging from antagonisms to mutualisms, form the architecture of biodiversity and determine ecosystem functioning. Understanding the rules responsible for who interacts with whom, as well as the functional consequences of these interspecific interactions, is central to predict community dynamics and stability. Species traits sensu lato may affect different ecological processes by determining species interactions through a two-step process. First, ecological and life-history traits govern species distributions and abundance, and hence determine species co-occurrence and the potential for species to interact. Secondly, morphological or physiological traits between co-occurring potential interaction partners should match for the realization of an interaction. Here, we review recent advances on predicting interactions from species co-occurrence and develop a probabilistic model for inferring trait matching. The models proposed here integrate both neutral and trait-matching constraints, while using only information about known interactions, thereby overcoming problems originating from undersampling of rare interactions (i.e. missing links). They can easily accommodate qualitative or quantitative data and can incorporate trait variation within species, such as values that vary along developmental stages or environmental gradients. We use three case studies to show that the proposed models can detect strong trait matching (e.g. predator–prey system), relaxed trait matching (e.g. herbivore–plant system) and barrier trait matching (e.g. plant–pollinator systems). Only by elucidating which species traits are important in each process (i.e. in determining interaction establishment and frequency), we can advance in explaining how species interact and the consequences of these interactions for ecosystem functioning.},

The assumptions are: 1) the animals are points in a 1-m3 homogeneous space, 2) the animals move at random and are randomly distributed, and 3) the predator animal has an encounter radius given by its sensory system. The mathematics of encounter probabilities are developed for a 3-dimensional space. The results show two optimal strategies: 1) cruising predators which prey upon slow moving animals (herbivores), and 2) ambush (nonmoving) predators which prey upon fast cruising prey. Of the variables used (population densities, speeds of the two animal species, and encounter radius) the encounter radius has the greatest influence on the encounter probabilities. The results suggest a simple community structure and point to the importance of studies on live zooplankton.},

abstract = {Speciation with gene flow is greatly facilitated when traits subject to divergent selection also contribute to non-random mating. Such traits have been called 'magic traits', which could be interpreted to imply that they are rare, special, or unrealistic. Here, we question this assumption by illustrating that magic traits can be produced by a variety of mechanisms, including ones in which reproductive isolation arises as an automatic by-product of adaptive divergence. We also draw upon the theoretical literature to explore whether magic traits have a unique role in speciation or can be mimicked in their effects by physically linked trait-complexes. We conclude that magic traits are more frequent than previously perceived, but further work is needed to clarify their importance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We developed a visual foraging model for piscivores that predicts search volume as a function of light and turbidity. We combined this model with diel hydroacoustic measurements of depth-specific prey fish densities during summer stratification in Lake Tahoe, Lake Washington, and Strawberry Reservoir to examine differences in diel, depth-specific visual encounter rates of prey. These study sites were selected to represent gradients of increasing limnetic prey fish density and declining transparency. The model predicted over a 30-fold difference in maximum depth-specific diel encounter rates among the three lakes. Lake Washington, which was characterized by intermediate transparency and moderate limnetic prey density, had the highest predicted prey encounter rates. The pattern of prey encounter rates among the three lakes was similar to the proportional contribution of limnetic prey fishes observed in the diet of piscivores from these waters. This approach may be used to construct temporally and spatially explicit trophic interaction models for examining mechanisms underlying predator and prey distributions or to predict the response of existing or introduced predators to changing environmental conditions, prey abundance, or distribution.},

In order to assess the related ecological adaptations in a marine predator, we studied the at-sea distribution and the diving behaviour of 23 cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo (Linnaeus) breeding at the Chausey Islands (France) using VHE-telemetry and data loggers recording hydrostatic pressure. Birds foraged within an area of approximately 1131 km(2) situated north-east of the breeding colony. This zone represents only 25 {\%} of the maximal potentially available area that the birds may utilize considering their maximum foraging range of 35 km. Individual birds remained within restricted individual foraging areas (on average 18 and 10{\%} of the total utilized area in 1994 and 1995, respectively) throughout the study period. Moreover, the cormorants studied conducted an average of 42 dives per foraging trip, lasting for an average of 40 s (maximum 152 s), and reached an average maximum dive depth of 6.1 m (maximum 32 m) with median descent and ascent angles calculated to be 18.7 degrees and 20.3 degrees, respectively. Overall, 64{\%} of all dives were U-shaped dives and 36{\%} V-shaped dives. We use these results to demonstrate how both specialization and opportunism may support the remarkably high foraging efficiency of this marine predator.},

abstract = {Trees that fall into lakes from riparian forest become habitat for aquatic organisms, and are potentially an important link between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Coarse woody habitat (CWH) promotes the production of benthic invertebrate prey and offers refuge for prey fishes, which are in turn consumed by piscivorous fishes. We used a simulation model to explore responses of an aquatic food web to changes in CWH caused by lakeshore residential development and windstorm, as well as to harvest of adult piscivores. Residential development had a negative effect on fishes, and could lead to extirpation of benthivorous prey fish species. In contrast, pulsed addition of CWH following a windstorm had little effect on the aquatic food web. Our results suggest that CWH is more important as shelter for prey fishes than as a substrate for benthic invertebrate production. However, piscivore harvest can supersede the role of CWH as prey shelter, leading to piscivore collapse and prey persistence even when CWH levels are low enough to promote piscivore dominance. Thus, the effects of lakeshore residential development on fishes can be masked by angler harvest of top piscivores. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To balance conflicting demands for food and safety from predation, feeding animals have two useful tools. First, they can vary the amount of time they devote to harvesting patches that vary in predation risk and feeding rates. Second, they can use vigilance to trade-off food and safety while feeding from a food patch. I present a model for predicting how an optimal forager should jointly use these two tools. Factors influencing the use of these tools include encounter rate with predators, predator lethality in the absence of vigilance, effectiveness of vigilance in reducing predator lethality, the marginal value of energy to the forager and the forager's survivor's fitness. Patch-use behaviours influenced by these factors include vigilance level, quitting harvest rate and giving-up density (GUD). All three of these patch-use behaviours should increase in response to an increase in encounter rate with predators, predator lethality and the forager's survivor's fitness, and decrease with an increase in the marginal value of energy. In response to increasing the effectiveness of vigilance, vigilance should increase and the GUD and quitting harvest rate should decline. The amount of food left by a forager in a depletable food patch, the GUD, provides an empirical link for testing the model's predictions. Giving-up densities should increase with increasing predation risk, and GUDs should increase with declining food-density-specific harvest rates. Differences in GUDs among food patches attributable to differences in quitting harvest rates measure the contribution of time allocation to managing differences in predation risk. Differences in GUDs attributable to differences in food-density-specific harvest rates measure the contribution of vigilance to managing predation risk.},

Eight natural alternatives are presented, each with its motivation and context. Each interval is examined as regards its coverage probability and its expected length.

abstract = {Population sizes of generalist consumers are increasing in many ecosystems because of various human activities, and it is critical to understand the trophic role of these generalist species if we are to predict how they may affect food web structure and ecosystem function. Lionfish Pterois volitans/miles have spread throughout the Western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and they may have significant effects on native faunal communities. We characterized the trophic ecology of lionfish in back reef habitats on Abaco Island, Bahamas, drawing on recently developed analytical tools that employ both direct diet information and stable isotope data. Although d 15N and d 13C bi-plot data appeared to suggest substantial niche overlap with native gray snapper and schoolmaster snapper, Bayesian analytical tools suggested differences in core isotopic niches among the species. This was consistent with direct diet information, as lionfish fed almost exclusively on small prey fishes and snapper fed more commonly on crustaceans. When combining empirical isotope and diet data in a simulation model, individual lionfish appear to be more specialized in their diets than schoolmaster snapper. We suggest that this pattern may be driven by high site-fidelity of lionfish, in conjunction with distinct prey assemblages at the patch scale. Lionfish are widely considered to be generalist predators, and our data reveal aspects of this trophic generality that must be considered as the role of lionfish in their invaded habitats continues to be examined. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

The landscape of fear represents relative levels of predation risk as peaks and valleys that reflect the level of fear of predation a prey experiences in different parts of its area of use. We provide observations in support of this model regarding changes in predation risk with respect to habitat types, and terrain characteristics. We postulate that animals have the ability to learn and can respond to differing levels of predation risk. We propose that the landscape of fear can be quantified with the use of well documented existing methods such as giving- up densities, vigilance observations, and foraging surveys of plants. We conclude that the landscape of fear is a useful visual model and has the potential to become a unifying ecological concept.},

The high level of abstraction of the models, however, impedes applications to empirical systems. We argue that further understanding of spatial dynamics in natural systems strongly depends on dense exchanges between field and theory. From empiricists, more and specific quantifications of spatial flows are needed, defined by the major categories of organismal movement (dispersal, foraging, life-cycle, and migration). In parallel, the theoretical framework must account for the distinct spatial scales at which these naturally common spatial flows occur. Integrating all levels of spatial connections among landscape elements will upgrade and unify landscape and meta-ecosystem ecology into a single framework for spatial ecology. Cross-ecosystem movements drive landscape dynamics.Among-ecosystem couplings are either dispersal- or resource-dominated.Dispersal-based couplings occur at the regional scale between similar habitat types.Resource-based couplings occur at the local scale between different habitat types.},

The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event.

A null model suggests that IGP in different groups of predators and prey (i.e. carnivores, omnivores, herbivores, detritivores, or top and intermediate species) have different deviations from a chance expectation, indicating these attributes of species biology as main determinants of IGP persistence. We suggest that IGP satisfies two basic requirements to be considered as important to the trophic structuring of communities. First, its occurrence is not random, rather it is associated with well-defined attributes of species biology, and secondly, it is a widespread interaction.},

Most of the current methods to infer the existence of interactions between two species require a good knowledge of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure, using the statistical relationship between predator and prey body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among a pool of species. * The novelty of our approach is to infer, for any species of a given species pool, the three species-specific parameters of the niche model. The method applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering the community. * We find that this method gives robust predictions of the structure of food webs and that its efficiency is increased when the strength of the body–size relationship between predators and preys increases. * We finally illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under different global change scenarios.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.},

abstract = {Climate change is inducing deep modifications in species geographic ranges worldwide. However, the consequences of such changes on community structure are still poorly understood, particularly the impacts on food-web properties. Here, we propose a new framework, coupling species distribution and trophic models, to predict climate change impacts on food-web structure across the Mediterranean Sea. Sea surface temperature was used to determine the fish climate niches and their future distributions. Body size was used to infer trophic interactions between fish species. Our projections reveal that 54 fish species of 256 endemic and native species included in our analysis would disappear by 2080-2099 from the Mediterranean continental shelf. The number of feeding links between fish species would decrease on 73.4{\%} of the continental shelf. However, the connectance of the overall fish web would increase on average, from 0.26 to 0.29, mainly due to a differential loss rate of feeding links and species richness. This result masks a systematic decrease in predator generality, estimated here as the number of prey species, from 30.0 to 25.4. Therefore, our study highlights large-scale impacts of climate change on marine food-web structure with potential deep consequences on ecosystem functioning. However, these impacts will likely be highly heterogeneous in space, challenging our current understanding of climate change impact on local marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society. There is a growing realization among community ecologists that interactions between species vary across space and time and that this variation needs to be quantified. Our current numerical framework to analyse the structure of species interactions, based on graph-theoretical  approaches, usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of network structure so that they can exploit it. We present analytical expressions of key measures of network structured, adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its variance. When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. We present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analysing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutation-based approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures. We discuss how both sampling and data representation of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

Since many exotic plants depend on native pollinators to successfully establish, it is of paramount importance that we understand precisely how exotic species integrate into existing plant-pollinator communities. 2. In this manuscript, we have studied a global data base of empirical pollination networks to determine whether community, network, species or interaction characteristics can help identify invaded communities. 3. We found that a limited number of community and network properties showed significant differences across the empirical data sets - namely networks with exotic plants present are characterized by greater total, plant and pollinator richness, as well as higher values of relative nestedness. 4. We also observed significant differences in terms of the pollinators that interact with the exotic plants. In particular, we found that specialist pollinators that are also weak contributors to community nestedness are far more likely to interact with exotic plants than would be expected by chance alone. 5. Synthesis. By virtue of their interactions, it appears that exotic plants may provide a key service to a community's specialist pollinators as well as fill otherwise vacant 'coevolutionary niches'.},

Several properties of food webs—the networks of feeding links between species—are known to vary systematically with the species richness of the underlying community. Under the ‘latitude–niche breadth hypothesis', which predicts that species in the tropics will tend to evolve narrower niches, one might expect that these scaling relationships could also be affected by latitude. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the scaling relationships between species richness and average generality, vulnerability and links per species across a set of 196 empirical food webs. In estuarine, marine and terrestrial food webs there was no effect of latitude on any scaling relationship, suggesting constant niche breadth in these habitats. In freshwater communities, on the other hand, there were strong effects of latitude on scaling relationships, supporting the latitude–niche breadth hypothesis. These contrasting findings indicate that it may be more important to account for habitat than latitude when exploring gradients in food-web structure.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Cambridge University Press. Variations in levels of parasitism among individuals in a population of hosts underpin the importance of parasites as an evolutionary or ecological force. Factors influencing parasite richness (number of parasite species) and load (abundance and biomass) at the individual host level ultimately form the basis of parasite infection patterns. In fish, diet range (number of prey taxa consumed) and prey selectivity (proportion of a particular prey taxon in the diet) have been shown to influence parasite infection levels. However, fish diet is most often characterized at the species or fish population level, thus ignoring variation among conspecific individuals and its potential effects on infection patterns among individuals. Here, we examined parasite infections and stomach contents of New Zealand freshwater fish at the individual level. We tested for potential links between the richness, abundance and biomass of helminth parasites and the diet range and prey selectivity of individual fish hosts. There was no obvious link between individual fish host diet and helminth infection levels. Our results were consistent across multiple fish host and parasite species and contrast with those of earlier studies in which fish diet and parasite infection were linked, hinting at a true disconnect between host diet and measures of parasite infections in our study systems. This absence of relationship between host diet and infection levels may be due to the relatively low richness of freshwater helminth parasites in New Zealand and high host-parasite specificity.},

Previous analyses of empirical food webs (the networks of who eats whom in a community) have revealed that parasites exert a strong influence over observed food web structure and alter many network properties such as connectance and degree distributions. It remains unclear, however, whether these community-level effects are fully explained by differences in the ways that parasites and free-living species interact within a food web. To rigorously quantify the interrelationship between food web structure, the types of species in a web and the distinct types of feeding links between them, we introduce a shared methodology to quantify the structural roles of both species and feeding links. Roles are quantified based on the frequencies with which a species (or link) appears in different food web motifs - the building blocks of networks. We hypothesized that different types of species (e.g. top predators, basal resources, parasites) and different types of links between species (e.g. classic predation, parasitism, concomitant predation on parasites along with their hosts) will show characteristic differences in their food web roles. We found that parasites do indeed have unique structural roles in food webs. Moreover, we demonstrate that different types of feeding links (e.g. parasitism, predation or concomitant predation) are distributed differently in a food web context. More than any other interaction type, concomitant predation appears to constrain the roles of parasites. In contrast, concomitant predation links themselves have more variable roles than any other type of interaction. Together, our results provide a novel perspective on how both species and feeding link composition shape the structure of an ecological community and vice versa.},

@article{Cirtwill2016a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd Aim: MacArthur and Wilson's original formulation of the theory of island biogeography (TIB) included the corollary hypothesis that species richness might affect immigration and extinction rates. Building on this, other researchers have suggested additional top-down and bottom-up effects. We compare these hypotheses to identify the strongest candidates for inclusion in a ‘trophic TIB'. Location: Six mangrove islands in the Florida Keys, USA. Methods: We studied a classic island biogeography time series featuring lists of species observed on six mangrove islands during roughly 16 censuses each across 700 days. We first used this time series to determine the number of opportunities for species to immigrate to an island for the first time (n = 18,420), to go locally extinct (n = 1943) or to re-immigrate to an island after having previously gone extinct (n = 1813). We then leveraged information on the predators and prey of those species to estimate the potential for top-down and bottom-up interactions during each census period. Finally, we constructed statistical models to test for species richness, top-down, and bottom-up effects on per-species immigration and extinction probabilities and validated them by comparing each model with a similar model based on the classic TIB. Results: We found that models including bottom-up effects gave the greatest improvement over the classic TIB models. Extinction probability in particular decreased sharply for species with both basal resources and animal prey available. Species richness and top-down effects had far weaker impacts on per-species probabilities of immigration and extinction. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that incorporating information on the trophic structure of island communities – particularly the species-specific availability of resources – can substantially alter predictions of extinction probabilities. Immigration probability, on the contrary, appeared largely stochastic. Incorporating trophic information into predictions of extinction rates therefore represents the most promising and best-supported way to extend the TIB.},

abstract = {Ecologists have taken two distinct approaches in studying the distribution and diversity of communities: a species-centric focus and an interaction-network based approach. A current frontier in community-level studies is the integration of these perspectives by investigating both simultaneously; one method for achieving this is evaluating the relative contributions of species turnover and host switching towards interaction turnover (i.e., the dissimilarity in interactions between two networks). We performed observations of plant-pollinator interactions to investigate (1) patterns in interaction turnover across spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients and (2) the relative contribution of pollinator species turnover, floral turnover, simultaneous pollinator {\&} floral turnover, and host switching towards interaction turnover. Field work was conducted on the Beartooth Plateau, an alpine ecosystem in Montana and Wyoming, with weekly observations of plant-pollinator interactions across one growing season. Interaction turnover increased through time, with magnitudes consistently greater than 80{\%}, even at time intervals as short as one week. Floral species turnover (41{\%}) and simultaneous floral and pollinator species turnover (36{\%}) accounted for almost all interaction turnover while host switching accounted for only 5{\%}. Interaction turnover also significantly increased with spatial and elevational distance, albeit with lesser magnitudes than with temporal distance. The marginal spatial pattern was present for only some taxa (Bombus spp. and solitary bee species), potentially indicating variable habitat use by pollinators across the landscape. Weak environmental trends may be a consequence of unmeasured environmental variables, yet our finding that environmental gradients structure plant-pollinator partitions had not previously been tested with empirical data. Our observations suggest that host switching does not readily occur at the scales of alpine flowering phenology (i.e. {\~{}}1 week); however, whether lack of host switching is indicative of inflexible pollinator foraging, or, more likely, a lack of opportunity or necessity to switch hosts, requires further investigation.},

Uncovering the causal relationship between abundance and generalisation has been hindered by a chicken-and-egg dilemma: is generalisation a by-product of being abundant, or does high abun- dance result from generalisation? Here, we analyse a database of plant–pollinator and plant–seed disperser networks, and provide strong evidence that the causal link between abundance and generalisation is uni-directional. Specifically, species appear to be generalists because they are more abundant, but the converse, that is that species become more abundant because they are generalists, is not supported by our analysis. Furthermore, null model analyses suggest that abun- dant species interact with many other species simply because they are more likely to encounter potential interaction partners.},

However, species interaction networks are typically constructed from temporally aggregated interaction data, thereby implicitly assuming that interactions are fixed. This approach has advanced our understanding of communities, but it obscures the timescale at which interactions form (or dissolve) and the drivers and consequences of such dynamics. We address this knowledge gap by quantifying the within-season turnover of plant–pollinator interactions from weekly censuses across 3 years in a subalpine ecosystem. Week-to-week turnover of interactions (1) was high, (2) followed a consistent seasonal progression in all years of study and (3) was dominated by interaction rewiring (the reassembly of interactions among species). Simulation models revealed that species' phenologies and relative abundances constrained both total interaction turnover and rewiring. Our findings reveal the diversity of species interactions that may be missed when the temporal dynamics of networks are ignored.},

In addition, switching can generate disruptive selection on such traits in a low-diversity community, increasing the number of species. Both of these processes should produce communities in which species differ in their values of the trophic trait, and display corresponding differences in the time-course of their switching from one resource to another. Here we present evidence for widespread switching behaviour for a diverse Mediterranean scrubland bird community. We show that species differ in a beak character related to their relative use of insect and fruit resource channels, and that the timing of switching is correlated with the relative use of resources. These patterns are consistent with theoretical predictions, suggesting a possible role of switching behaviour in promoting avian coexistence and diversification.},

abstract = {Ecological network patterns are influenced by diverse processes that operate at different temporal rates. Here we analyzed whether the coupled effect of local abundance variation, seasonally phenotypic plastic responses, and species evolutionary adaptations might act in concert to shape network patterns. We studied the temporal variation in three interaction properties of bird species (number of interactions per species, interaction strength, and interaction asymmetry) in a temporal sequence of 28 plant-frugivore interaction networks spanning two years in a Mediterranean shrubland community. Three main hypotheses dealing with the temporal variation of network properties were tested, examining the effects of abundance, switching behavior between alternative food resources, and morphological traits in determining consumer interaction patterns. Our results demonstrate that temporal variation in consumer interaction patterns is explained by short-term variation in resource and bird abundances and seasonal dietary switches between alternative resources (fleshy fruits and insects). Moreover, differences in beak morphology are associated with differences in switching behavior between resources, suggesting an important role of foraging adaptations in determining network patterns. We argue that beak shape adaptations might determine generalist and specialist feeding behaviors and thus the positions of consumer species within the network. Finally, we provide a preliminary framework to interpret phylogenetic signal in plant-animal networks. Indeed, we show that the strength of the phylogenetic signal in networks depends on the relative importance of abundance, behavioral, and morphological variables. We show that these variables strongly differ in their phylogenetic signal. Consequently, we suggest that moderate and significant phylogenetic effects should be commonly observed in networks of species interactions.},

abstract = {The effects of climate change on species interactions are poorly understood. Investigating the mechanisms by which species interactions may shift under altered environmental conditions will help form a more predictive understanding of such shifts. In particular, components of climate change have the potential to strongly influence floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and, in turn, plant-pollinator interactions. In this study, we experimentally manipulated drought and herbivory for four forb species to determine effects of these treatments and their interactions on (1) visual plant traits traditionally associated with pollinator attraction, (2) floral VOCs, and (3) the visitation rates and community composition of pollinators. For all forbs tested, experimental drought universally reduced flower size and floral display, but there were species-specific effects of drought on volatile emissions per flower, the composition of compounds produced, and subsequent pollinator visitation rates. Moreover, the community of pollinating visitors was influenced by drought across forb species (i.e., some pollinator species were deterred by drought while others were attracted). Together, these results indicate that VOCs may provide more nuanced information to potential floral visitors and may be relatively more important than visual traits for pollinator attraction, particularly under shifting environmental conditions.

While there are reliable ways to characterize specificity at individual and community levels, the evaluation of population and species-level measures is lacking. There is a need for such assessments given that populations and species are the relevant scales for most ecological and evolutionary processes. 2. Using examples of simulated and empirical data sets of bipartite networks representing a continuum of biological interactions, we evaluate six indices of specificity in terms of their robustness to incomplete sampling and information they extract from data. 3. Robustness differed between the measures and in their ability to differentiate specialists and generalists along a full continuum. On the empirical data sets, indices were less separated by their informativity than on the simulated data sets, which may be due to the heterogeneity of the former. 4. Based on these different evaluations for species-level (or population-level) specificity, we recommend the use of Resource range when no quantitative data are available and Paired Difference Index otherwise. These results will assist both applied and fundamental researchers in the characterization and interpretation of species specificity.},

abstract = {We analysed the dynamics of a plant-pollinator interaction network of a scrub community surveyed over four consecutive years. Species composition within the annual networks showed high temporal variation. Temporal dynamics were also evident in the topology of the network, as interactions among plants and pollinators did not remain constant through time. This change involved both the number and the identity of interacting partners. Strikingly, few species and interactions were consistently present in all four annual plant-pollinator networks (53{\%} of the plant species, 21{\%} of the pollinator species and 4.9{\%} of the interactions). The high turnover in species-to-species interactions was mainly the effect of species turnover (c. 70{\%} in pairwise comparisons among years), and less the effect of species flexibility to interact with new partners (c. 30{\%}). We conclude that specialization in plant-pollinator interactions might be highly overestimated when measured over short periods of time. This is because many plant or pollinator species appear as specialists in 1 year, but tend to be generalists or to interact with different partner species when observed in other years. The high temporal plasticity in species composition and interaction identity coupled with the low variation in network structure properties (e.g. degree centralization, connectance, nestedness, average distance and network diameter) imply (i) that tight and specialized coevolution might not be as important as previously suggested and (ii) that plant-pollinator interaction networks might be less prone to detrimental effects of disturbance than previously thought. We suggest that this may be due to the opportunistic nature of plant and animal species regarding the available partner resources they depend upon at any particular time.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors determining the spatial and temporal variation of ecological networks is fundamental to the knowledge of their dynamics and functioning. In this study, we evaluate the effect of elevation and time on the structure of plant-flower-visitor networks in a Colombian mountain forest. We examine the level of generalization of plant and animal species and the identity of interactions in 44 bipartite matrices obtained from eight altitudinal levels, from 2200 to 2900 m during eight consecutive months. The contribution of altitude and time to the overall variation in the number of plant (P) and pollinator (A) species, network size (M), number of interactions (I), connectance (C), and nestedness was evaluated. In general, networks were small, showed high connectance values and non-nested patterns of organization. Variation in P, M, I and C was better accounted by time than elevation, seemingly related to temporal variation in precipitation. Most plant and insect species were specialists and the identity of links showed a high turnover over months and at every 100 m elevation. The partition of the whole system into smaller network units allowed us to detect small-scale patterns of interaction that contrasted with patterns commonly described in cumulative networks. The specialized but erratic pattern of network organization observed in this tropical mountain suggests that high connectance coupled with opportunistic attachment may confer robustness to plant-flower-visitor networks occurring at small spatial and temporal units.},

Our ability to predict the impact of wildfire-created$\backslash$nheterogeneity on biodiversity is limited because few studies have$\backslash$ninvestigated variation in community composition (beta-diversity) in$\backslash$nresponse to fire. Wildfires may influence beta-diversity through several$\backslash$necological mechanisms. First, highseverity fires may decrease$\backslash$nbeta-diversity by homogenizing species composition when they create$\backslash$nlandscapes dominated by disturbance-tolerant or rapidly colonizing$\backslash$nspecies. In contrast, mixed-severity fires may increase beta-diversity$\backslash$nby creating mosaic landscapes containing habitats that support species$\backslash$nwith differing environmental tolerances and dispersal traits. Moreover,$\backslash$nthe effects of fire severity on betadiversity may change depending on$\backslash$nsite conditions. Disturbance is hypothesized to increase local species$\backslash$nrichness at higher productivity and decrease local species richness at$\backslash$nlower productivity, a process that can have important, but largely$\backslash$nunexamined, consequences on beta-diversity in fire-prone ecosystems. We$\backslash$ntested these hypotheses by comparing patterns of beta-diversity and$\backslash$nspecies richness across 162 plant communities in three sites that span a$\backslash$nlarge-scale gradient in climate and productivity in the Northern Rockies$\backslash$nof Montana. Within each site, we used spatially explicit fire-severity$\backslash$ndata to stratify sampling across unburned forests and forests burned$\backslash$nwith mixed-and high-severity wildfires.

This$\backslash$npattern may be explained by rapid regeneration of woody plants after$\backslash$nfire in high-productivity forests. Moreover, forbs and woody plants had$\backslash$ndisproportionately higher overall species richness in mixed-severity$\backslash$nfire compared to high-severity fire, but only at the low-productivity$\backslash$nsite.

abstract = {Ecologists have taken two distinct approaches in studying the distribution and diversity of communities: a species-centric focus and an interaction-network based approach. A current frontier in community-level studies is the integration of these perspectives by investigating both simultaneously; one method for achieving this is evaluating the relative contributions of species turnover and host switching towards interaction turnover (i.e., the dissimilarity in interactions between two networks). We performed observations of plant-pollinator interactions to investigate (1) patterns in interaction turnover across spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients and (2) the relative contribution of pollinator species turnover, floral turnover, simultaneous pollinator {\&} floral turnover, and host switching towards interaction turnover. Field work was conducted on the Beartooth Plateau, an alpine ecosystem in Montana and Wyoming, with weekly observations of plant-pollinator interactions across one growing season. Interaction turnover increased through time, with magnitudes consistently greater than 80{\%}, even at time intervals as short as one week. Floral species turnover (41{\%}) and simultaneous floral and pollinator species turnover (36{\%}) accounted for almost all interaction turnover while host switching accounted for only 5{\%}. Interaction turnover also significantly increased with spatial and elevational distance, albeit with lesser magnitudes than with temporal distance. The marginal spatial pattern was present for only some taxa (Bombus spp. and solitary bee species), potentially indicating variable habitat use by pollinators across the landscape. Weak environmental trends may be a consequence of unmeasured environmental variables, yet our finding that environmental gradients structure plant-pollinator partitions had not previously been tested with empirical data. Our observations suggest that host switching does not readily occur at the scales of alpine flowering phenology (i.e. {\~{}}1 week); however, whether lack of host switching is indicative of inflexible pollinator foraging, or, more likely, a lack of opportunity or necessity to switch hosts, requires further investigation.},

Yet, understanding network dynamics is important in order to relate network patterns to ecological processes. We studied the day-to-day dynamics of an arctic pollination interaction network over two consecutive seasons. First, we found that new species entering the network tend to interact with already well-connected species, although there are deviations from this trend due, for example, to morphological mismatching between plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping phenophases of plant and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics provides a mechanistic explanation for previously reported network patterns such as the heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across species. Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and phenophase length were important determinants of the number of links per species.},

Evaluated together, such a collection of studies can offer insight into the importance and function of these factors in nature. Using a new factorial meta-analysis technique, we combined the results of 20 articles reporting on 39 published field experiments to ask whether the presence of predators affects the intensity of competitive effects and to compare the average effects of competition and predation. Across all studies, the effects of competition in the presence of predators were less than in the absence of predators, and the interaction between competition and predation for most response variables was statistically significant. Removal of competitors had much more positive effects on organisms' growth and mass than did exclusion of predators. Predator exclusion had much more beneficial effects on organisms' survival than did competition. The mean effects of competition and predation on density did not differ from one another. The results differed among trophic levels. Further understanding would benefit greatly from more field experiments that manipulate both competition and predation, that focus on a wider range of organisms and environments, that focus on population-level parameters such as density, and that report results more completely, including data such as sample sizes and variances.},

abstract = {Communities consist of species and their interactions. They can thus be described as networks, with species as nodes and interactions as links. Within such networks, the diversity of nodes and the distribution of links may affect patterns of energy transfer between trophic levels, the dynamics of the system, and the outcome in terms of ecosystem functioning. To date, most descriptions of networks have focused on single or relatively few sites, and have oftentimes been built on poorly resolved nodes and links. Yet, comparisons of local interaction networks reveal variation in space and in time, thus spurring interest in methods and theory for understanding patterns, drivers, and consequences of this variation. Progress in this field relies on access to replicate samples of comparable food webs across large spatiotemporal scales, resolved to species rather than to compound nodes. Due to the massive efforts required, high-quality data sets are still scarce. We created a data set on a single community type sampled across Europe: willow species (Salix), willow-galling sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae: Nematinae: Euurina), and their natural enemies (hymenopteran parasitoids and coleopteran, lepidopteran, dipteran, and hymenopteran inquilines). Each sample was referenced in space and time, and each node resolved with the highest possible resolution, including taxonomic affinity, gall type (for herbivores), and mode of parasitism (for natural enemies). Galler survival and link structure were resolved by dissection and rearing of gall inhabitants. In total, the data set is based on 641 site visits over 29 years, and on 165,424 galls representing 96 herbivore nodes and 52 plant nodes. The dissections and rearings yielded 42,129 natural enemies belonging to 126 species, and revealed 1,173 different links. The spatiotemporal and taxonomic resolution of these data make them amenable to analyses of both ecological and evolutionary processes of network assembly. Thus, this data set will facilitate testing of important hypotheses in recent community theory, concerning, e.g., the sampling effort needed to adequately describe interaction structure within ecological communities, the impact of environmental conditions and biotic filters on the distribution of species and their interactions, and the relationship between the global “metaweb” and its local realizations.},

The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of $\beta$-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up $\beta$-diversity of community composition to the $\beta$-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

Prey species sharing an enemy (predator or parasitoid) can be linked by apparent competition, but it is unknown whether this process is strong enough to be a community-wide structuring mechanism that could be used to predict future states of diverse food webs. Whether species abundances are spatially coupled by enemy movement across different habitats is also untested. Here, using a field experiment, we show that predicted apparent competitive effects between species, mediated via shared parasitoids, can significantly explain future parasitism rates and herbivore abundances. These predictions are successful even across edges between natural and managed forests, following experimental reduction of herbivore densities by aerial spraying of insecticide over 20[thinsp]hectares. This result shows that trophic indirect effects propagate across networks and habitats in important, predictable ways, with implications for landscape planning, invasion biology and biological control.},

We tracked the fate of seeds handled by these animals to examine how seasonal food availability may influence caching rates, dispersal distances and cache longevity. Most seeds exposed to dispersal trials were removed by scatter-hoarders during the first week in both seasons and seeds were generally buried intact in single-seeded caches within 10 m of seed stations. Seeds were removed significantly faster and buried at greater distances during the dry season. The proportion of seeds buried intact was considerably higher in the wet season (74.4{\%}) than in the dry season (38.2{\%}). Most (99.4{\%}) of the 881 primary caches monitored were recovered, but these had a significantly shorter lifetime in the dry season. Our results show that rodents are highly skilled at retrieving buried Brazil nuts and that caching behaviour appears to be affected by seasonal resource abundance.

Although, early food web data appeared to verify this, recently many ecologists have found omnivory to be ubiquitous in food web data gathered at a high taxonomic resolution. In this paper, we re-investigate the role of omnivory in food webs using a non-equilibrium perspective. We find that the addition of omnivory to a simple food chain model (thus a simple food web) locally stabilizes the food web in a very complete way. First, non-equilibrium dynamics (e.g. chaos) tend to be eliminated or bounded further away from zero via period-doubling reversals invoked by the omnivorous trophic link. Second, food chains without interior attractors tend to gain a stable interior attractor with moderate amounts of omnivory.},

Key metrics of network structure were strongly affected by the size of the interaction matrix (i.e. the total number of interactions documented between individuals) and by the taxonomic diversity of the host taxa involved. After controlling for these sampling effects, quantitative networks showed no consistent structural patterns across latitude and host guilds, suggesting that there may be basic rules for how sets of antagonists interact with resource species. Furthermore, the strong association between network size and structure implies that many apparent spatial and temporal variations in network structure may prove to be artefacts.},

abstract = {Ecological networks depict the interactions between species, mainly based on observations in the field. The information contained in such interac-tion matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modu-larity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substan-tial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in exper-imental setups.},

We propose a conceptual framework to infer the backbone of biotic interaction networks within regional species pools. First, interacting groups are identified to order links and remove forbidden interactions between species. Second, additional links are removed by examination of the geographical context in which species co-occur. Third, hypotheses are proposed to establish interaction probabilities between species.

abstract = {By specialising on specific resources, species evolve advantageous morphologies to increase the efficiency of nutrient acquisition. However, many specialists face variation in resource availability and composition. Whether specialists respond to these changes depends on the composition of the resource pulses, the cost of foraging on poorly matched resources, and the strength of interspecific competition. We studied hummingbird bill and plant corolla matching during seasonal variation in flower availability and morphology. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we accounted for the detectability and spatial overlap of hummingbird-plant interactions. We found that despite sea- sonal pulses of flowers with short-corollas, hummingbirds consistently foraged on well-matched flowers, leading to low niche overlap. This behaviour suggests that the costs of searching for rare and more specialised resources are lower than the benefit of switching to super-abundant resources. Our results highlight the trade-off between foraging efficiency and interspecific competi- tion, and underline niche partitioning in maintaining tropical diversity.},

abstract = {With habitat fragmentation spreading around the world, there is a pressing need to understand its impacts on local food webs. To date, few studies have examined the effects of landscape context on multiple local communities in a quantitative, spatially realistic setting. To examine how the isolation of a food web affects its structure, we construct local food webs of specialist herbivores and their natural enemies on 82 individual oaks (Quercus robur) growing in different landscape contexts. Across this set of webs, we find that communities in isolated habitat patches not only contained fewer species than did well-connected ones, but also differed in species composition. Surprisingly, the effects observed in terms of species composition were not reflected in the quantitative interaction structure of local food webs: landscape context had no detectable effect on either the interaction evenness, linkage density, connectance, generality or vulnerability of local webs. We conclude that the quantitative structure of food webs may be stable in the face of habitat fragmentation, despite clear-cut impacts on individual species. This finding offers hope-inspiring news for conservation, but should clearly be verified by empirical studies across both naturally and more recently fragmented systems},

abstract = {To determine the causes, frequency and stability of biotic interactions, ecologists often use field observations to generate networks of interacting species. The challenge is in determining whether unobserved interactions were undetected due to sampling, or whether they truly do not occur. This uncertainty makes it difficult to predict interactions based on ecological mechanisms. By using hierarchical Bayesian N-mixture models adapted from wildlife ecology, we differentiated the probability of detecting a species from the intensity of species interactions. We began with a brief simulation to illustrate the consequences of ignoring detectability when building species networks. We then applied our model to an empirical dataset on Andean hummingbirds to compare trait-matching and plant abundance in explaining flower visitation patterns. The daily probability of detecting a hummingbird interaction ranged from 14{\%} to 70{\%} among species, underlining the importance of multiple days of sampling when estimating species interactions. The trait-matching model best fit hummingbird visitation rates among plants and pollinators. The plant abundance model was inconsistent across hummingbird species and did not support neutral interactions based on increasing plant abundance. We recommend that network studies account for interaction detectability by separately modeling observation and process mechanisms, focusing on species-level discrepancy in assessing model adequacy, and estimating uncertainty when computing network statistics.},

The local stability properties of the resulting food web models were then determined. * 5We found that by choosing interaction strengths using an empirically defined scaling law, the resulting food web models are always dynamically stable, despite the residual uncertainties in the modelling approach. This contrasts with the statistical expectation that random webs with random parameters have a vanishingly improbable chance of stability. * 6The patterning of predator and prey body sizes in real ecosystems affects the arrangement of interaction strengths, which in turn determines food web stability.},

abstract = {The effects of predator-prey body size ratios on the resilience and probability of stability in linear Lotka-Volterra food chains have been analysed. The prey per capita interaction strengths of the model is assumed to be negatively correlated to the relative size difference between a predator and its prey. The relationship between prey interaction strength and predator-prey body size ratios is motivated by energetical arguments. Analytical results show that, given this assumption (on prey interaction strengths) and if average (relative) size differences between predators and their prey decrease with the trophic position of the consumer (as found in a large number of 'real food webs') the probability of local stability in model food chains is increased (when compared to model chains with a constant predator-prey body size ratio). Numerical simulations show that in most cases, the effect on the probability of stability is accompanied by an increase in resilience. For example, as model food chain length is increased from two to three trophic levels in one simulation, the return time increases by more than two orders of magnitude with a constant predator-prey body mass ratio while chains longer than four are not feasible. With a decreasing predator-prey body mass ratio on the other hand, the return time does not increase as rapidly and feasible equilibria exist for longer chains. The relationship between resilience and food chain length is, in this model, affected by the relationship between the predator-prey body mass ratio and the trophic position of the predator, that is, how fast this ratio decreases with increasing trophic height. The effect of body mass on consumer mortality rates, and subsequently on the probability of stability and resilience is also analysed. Decreasing mortality rates with increasing body size do not change the results qualitatively, it only increases the probability that an equilibrium is feasible.},

abstract = {Body size is a major phenotypic trait of individuals that commonly differentiates co-occurring species. We analyzed inter-specific competitive interactions between a large consumer and smaller competitors, whose energetics, selection and giving-up behaviour on identical resource patches scaled with individual body size. The aim was to investigate whether pure metabolic constraints on patch behaviour of vagile species can determine coexistence conditions consistent with existing theoretical and experimental evidence. We used an individual- based spatially explicit simulation model at a spatial scale defined by the home range of the large consumer, which was assumed to be parthenogenic and semelparous. Under exploitative conditions, competitive coexistence occurred in a range of body size ratios between 2 and 10. Asymmetrical competition and the mechanism underlying asymmetry, determined by the scaling of energetics and patch behaviour with consumer body size, were the proximate determinant of inter-specific coexistence. The small consumer exploited patches more efficiently, but searched for profitable patches less effectively than the larger competitor. Therefore, body- size related constraints induced niche partitioning, allowing competitive coexistence within a set of conditions where the large consumer maintained control over the small consumer and resource dynamics. The model summarises and extends the existing evidence of species coexistence on a limiting resource, and provides a mechanistic explanation for decoding the size-abundance distribution patterns commonly observed at guild and community levels.},

abstract = {Theory predicts that intraspecific genetic variation can increase the complexity of an ecological network. To date, however, we are lacking empirical knowledge of the extent to which genetic variation determines the assembly of ecological networks, as well as how the gain or loss of genetic variation will affect network structure. To address this knowledge gap, we used a common garden experiment to quantify the extent to which heritable trait variation in a host plant determines the assembly of its associated insect food web (network of trophic interactions). We then used a resampling procedure to simulate the additive effects of genetic variation on overall food-web complexity. We found that trait variation among host-plant genotypes was associated with resistance to insect herbivores, which indirectly affected interactions between herbivores and their insect parasitoids. Direct and indirect genetic effects resulted in distinct compositions of trophic interactions associated with each host-plant genotype. Moreover, our simulations suggest that food-web complexity would increase by 20{\%} over the range of genetic variation in the experimental population of host plants. Taken together, our results indicate that intraspecific genetic variation can play a key role in structuring ecological networks, which may in turn affect network persistence.},

Our current numerical framework to analyse the structure of species interactions, based on graph-theoretical approaches, usually do not consider the variability of interactions. As this variability has been show to hold valuable ecological information, there is a need to adapt the current measures of network structure so that they can exploit it. * We present analytical expressions of key measures of network structured, adapted so that they account for the variability of ecological interactions. We do so by modelling each interaction as a Bernoulli event; using basic calculus allows expressing the expected value, and when mathematically tractable, its variance. When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. * We present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analysing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutation-based approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures. * We discuss how both sampling and data representation of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the Ecological Society of America Some parasites move from one host to another via trophic transmission, the consumption of the parasite (inside its current host) by its future host. Feeding links among free-living species can thus be understood as potential transmission routes for parasites. As these links have different dynamic and structural properties, they may also vary in their effectiveness as trophic transmission routes. That is, some links may be better than others in allowing parasites to complete their complex life cycles. However, not all links are accessible to parasites as most are restricted to a small number of host taxa. This restriction means that differences between links involving host and non-host taxa must be considered when assessing whether transmission routes for parasites have different food web properties than other links. Here we use four New Zealand lake food webs to test whether link properties (contribution of a link to the predator's diet, prey abundance, prey biomass, amount of biomass transferred, centrality, and asymmetry) affect trophic transmission of parasites. Critically, we do this using both models that neglect the taxonomy of free-living species and models that explicitly include information about which free-living species are members of suitable host taxa. Although the best-fit model excluding taxonomic information suggested that transmission routes have different properties than other feeding links, when including taxonomy, the best-fit model included only an intercept. This means that the taxonomy of free-living species is a key determinant of parasite transmission routes and that food-web properties of transmission routes are constrained by the properties of host taxa. In particular, many intermediate hosts (prey) attain high biomasses and are involved in highly central links while links connecting intermediate to definitive (predator) hosts tend to be dynamically weak.},

abstract = {Regeneration of the magnetic field by convection in the core places demands on heat flow into the base of the mantle. If the heat flow is too low, thermal convection is shut off and the rate of generation of compositional buoyancy by the solidification of the core becomes too low to sustain the geodynamo. Conversely, a large heat flow causes rapid growth of the inner core, so that convection prior to the appearance of the inner core must be sustained by thermal buoyancy alone. The attendant requirements on primordial heat become more severe as the age of the inner core decreases. We show that estimates of the present-day heat flow satisfy the power requirements for the geodynamo. However, the resulting thermal history is incompatible with estimates of mantle temperatures prior to 3 Ga. This discrepancy can be resolved by accumulating radioactive isotopes in D or adding heat sources to the core.},

@article{Dominguez-Garcia2016,
abstract = {Food webs -- networks of predators and prey -- have long been known to exhibit "intervality": species can generally be ordered along a single axis in such a way that the prey of any given predator tend to lie on unbroken compact intervals. Although the meaning of this axis -- identified with a "niche" dimension -- has remained a mystery, it is assumed to lie at the basis of the highly non-trivial structure of food webs. With this in mind, most trophic network modelling has for decades been based on assigning species a niche value by hand. However, we argue here that intervality should not be considered the cause but rather a consequence of food-web structure. First, analysing a set of {\$}46{\$} empirical food webs, we find that they also exhibit {\{}$\backslash$it predator{\}} intervality: the predators of any given species are as likely to be contiguous as the prey are, but in a different ordering. Furthermore, this property is not exclusive of trophic networks: several networks of genes, neurons, metabolites, cellular machines, airports, and words are found to be approximately as interval as food webs. We go on to show that a simple model of food-web assembly which does not make use of a niche axis can nevertheless generate significant intervality. Therefore, the niche dimension (in the sense used for food-web modelling) could in fact be the consequence of other, more fundamental structural traits, such as trophic coherence. We conclude that a new approach to food-web modelling is required for a deeper understanding of ecosystem assembly, structure and function, and propose that certain topological features thought to be specific of food webs are in fact common to many complex networks.},

abstract = {How networks of ecological interactions are structured has a major impact on their functioning. However, accurately resolving both the nodes of the webs and the links between them is fraught with difficulties. We ask whether the new resolution conferred by molecular information changes perceptions of network structure. To probe a network of antagonistic interactions in the High Arctic, we use two complementary sources of molecular data: parasitoid DNA sequenced from the tissues of their hosts and host DNA sequenced from the gut of adult parasitoids. The information added by molecular analysis radically changes the properties of interaction structure. Overall, three times as many interaction types were revealed by combining molecular information from parasitoids and hosts with rearing data, versus rearing data alone. At the species level, our results alter the perceived host specificity of parasitoids, the parasitoid load of host species, and the web-wide role of predators with a cryptic lifestyle. As the northernmost network of host-parasitoid interactions quantified, our data point exerts high leverage on global comparisons of food web structure. However, how we view its structure will depend on what information we use: compared with variation among networks quantified at other sites, the properties of our web vary as much or much more depending on the techniques used to reconstruct it. We thus urge ecologists to combine multiple pieces of evidence in assessing the structure of interaction webs, and suggest that current perceptions of interaction structure may be strongly affected by the methods used to construct them.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In nature, fluxes across habitats often bring both nutrient and energetic resources into areas of low productivity from areas of higher productivity. These inputs can alter consumption rates of consumer and predator species in the recipient food webs, thereby influencing food web stability. Starting from a well‐studied tritrophic food chain model, we investigated the impact of allochthonous inputs on the stability of a simple food web model. We considered the effects of allochthonous inputs on stability of the model using four sets of biologically plausible parameters that represent different dynamical outcomes. We found that low levels of allochthonous inputs stabilize food web dynamics when species preferentially feed on the autochthonous sources, while either increasing the input level or changing the feeding preference to favor allochthonous inputs, or both, led to a decoupling of the food chain that could result in the loss of one or all species. We argue that allochthonous inputs are important sources of productivity in many food webs and their influence needs to be studied further. This is especially important in the various systems, such as caves, headwater streams, and some small marine islands, in which more energy enters the food web from allochthonous inputs than from autochthonous inputs.},

Here we show that these interaction strengths are structured nonran- domly in a large Caribbean marine food web. Specifically, the cooccurrence of strong interactions on two consecutive levels of food chains occurs less frequently than expected by chance. Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompa- nied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide effects remains a threat},

abstract = {Top–down control of phytoplankton biomass through piscivorous fish manipulation has been explored in numerous ecological and biomanipulation experiments. Piscivores are gape-limited predators and it is hypothesized that the distribution of gape sizes relative to distribution of body depths of prey fish may restrict piscivore effects cascading to plankton. We examined the top–down effects of piscivorous largemouth bass on nutrients, turbidity, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish in ponds containing fish assemblages with species representing a range of body sizes and feeding habits (western mosquitofish, bluegill, channel catfish, gizzard shad and common carp). The experimental design consisted of three replicated treatments: fishless ponds (NF), fish community without largemouth bass (FC), and fish community with largemouth bass (FCB). Turbidity, chlorophyll a, cyclopoid copepodid and copepod nauplii densities were significantly greater in FC and FCB ponds than in NF ponds. However, these response variables were not significantly different in FC and FCB ponds. The biomass and density of shallow-bodied western mosquitofish were reduced and bluegill body depths shifted toward larger size classes in the presence of largemouth bass, but the biomass and density of all other fish species and of the total fish community were unaffected by the presence of largemouth bass. Our results show that top–down impacts of largemouth bass in ecosystems containing small- and deep-bodied fish species may be most intense at the top of the food web and alter the size distribution and species composition of the fish community. However, these top–down effects may not cascade to the level of the plankton when large-bodied benthivorous fish species are abundant.},

We used data from 402 individuals to examine pattems of intergroup transfer in prairie voles {\{}Microtus ochrogaster). Nearly 32{\%} of established social groups (single female units, male-female pairs, or communal groups of at least 2 adults of the same sex) were joined by 1 or more individuals. Most individuals (76{\%}) that joined social groups were wanderers that were either unmarked, recently marked during grid trapping, or marked transients; 70{\%} were males. Joining a group was not contingent upon recent disappearance of residents. Total number of residents positively affected the probability of a female joining a social group, whereas number of adult female residents and population density negatively affected it. Some individuals (24{\%}) moved directly from one group to another without an intervening wandering stage; we refer to these instances of intergroup transfer as direct transfers. Most direct transferers moved into nearby groups, but not the closest group. Males were more likely than females to directly transfer into groups with potential mates and without potential competitors. Thus, males directly transferred in a manner consistent with maximizing reproductive opportunities. In contrast, 25{\%} of females directly transferred into groups without potential mates and 96{\%} into groups with at least 1 adult female. Females may be less constrained by group composition with respect to potential mates because wandering males, with which females can mate, ai{\^{}}e prevalent. All-male groups almost never occur in our population, so females probably cannot avoid joining groups with competitors.}},

abstract = {Species extinction following habitat loss is well documented. However, these extinctions do not happen immediately. The biodiversity surplus (extinction debt) declines with some delay through the process of relaxation. Estimating the time constants of relaxation, mainly the expected time to first extinction and the commonly used time for half the extinction debt to be paid off (half-life), is crucial for conservation purposes. Currently, there is no agreement on the rate of relaxation and the factors that it depends on. Here we find that half-life increases with area for all groups examined in a large meta-analysis of extinction data. A common pattern emerges if we use average number of individuals per species before habitat loss as an area index: for mammals, birds, reptiles and plants, the relationship has an exponent close to a half. We also find that the time to first determined extinction is short and increases slowly with area.},

abstract = {Food webs have been found to exhibit remarkable motif profiles, patterns in the relative prevalences of all possible three-species sub-graphs, and this has been related to ecosystem properties such as stability and robustness. Analysing 46 food webs of various kinds, we find that most food webs fall into one of two distinct motif families. The separation between the families is well predicted by a global measure of hierarchical order in directed networks - trophic coherence. We find that trophic coherence is also a good predictor for the extent of omnivory, defined as the tendency of species to feed on multiple trophic levels. We compare our results to a network assembly model that admits tunable trophic coherence via a single free parameter. The model is able to generate food webs in either of the two families by varying this parameter, and correctly classifies almost all the food webs in our database. This establishes a link between global order and local preying patterns in food webs.},

abstract = {The notion of 'community-wide character displacement' hypothesizes that locally co-existing sets of competing species should be less similar than expected when compared to random expectations from a broader regional species pool. Here I use a mechanistic approach to the niche concept to show how this expectation is dependent on the types of traits involved. I investigate how two different niche components, those that relate to species' requirements (or responses to environmental factors) versus those that relate to species' impacts (or effects on environmental factors), affect predictions about the similarity of locally co-existing species. In contrast with more conventional approaches that focus on species impacts, I focus on species responses to conclude that locally co-existing species should be more similar in such traits than expected on the basis of random asortment from a larger equilibrium regional biota. In addition, I explore the evolutionary implications of exceptions that might favour the co-existence of species with dissimilar traits (especially those that determine species' impacts on the environment) and conclude that these implications differ when species compete for shared resources, interact via shared predators, or interact via both mechanisms. The analysis developed in this paper shows that the co-existence of species that are more similar than expected by chance is not incompatible with the notion of strongly interacting species in saturated local communities near equilibrium.},

abstract = {The herbivorous insects of tropical forests constitute some of the most diverse communities of living organisms. For this reason it has been difficult to discover the degree to which these communities are structured, and by what processes. Interspecific competition for resources does occur, but its contemporary importance is limited because most pairs of potentially competing insects feed on different host plants. An alternative way in which species can interact is through shared natural enemies, a process called apparent competition. Despite extensive theoretical discussion there are few field demonstrations of apparent competition, and none in hyper-diverse tropical communities. Here, we experimentally removed two species of herbivore from a community of leaf-mining insects in a tropical forest. We predicted that other species that share natural enemies with the two removed species would experience lower parasitism and have higher population densities in treatment compared with control sites. In both cases (on removal of a dipteran and a coleopteran leaf-miner species) we found significantly lower parasitism, and in one case (removal of the dipteran) we found significantly higher abundance a year after the manipulation. Our results suggest that apparent competition may be important in structuring tropical insect communities.},

abstract = {Biological networks, such as those describing gene regulation, signal transduction, and neural synapses, are representations of large-scale dynamic systems. Discovery of organizing principles of biological networks can be enhanced by embracing the notion that there is a deep interplay between network structure and system dynamics. Recently, many structural characteristics of these non-random networks have been identified, but dynamical implications of the features have not been explored comprehensively. We demonstrate by exhaustive computational analysis that a dynamical property--stability or robustness to small perturbations--is highly correlated with the relative abundance of small subnetworks (network motifs) in several previously determined biological networks. We propose that robust dynamical stability is an influential property that can determine the non-random structure of biological networks.},

abstract = {Large, complex networks of ecological interactions with random structure tend invariably to instability. This mathematical relationship between complexity and local stability ignited a debate that has populated ecological literature for more than three decades. Here we show that, when species interact as predators and prey, systems as complex as the ones observed in nature can still be stable. Moreover, stability is highly robust to perturbations of interaction strength, and is largely a property of structure driven by predator - prey loops with the stability of these small modules cascading into that of the whole network. These results apply to empirical food webs and models that mimic the structure of natural systems as well. These findings are also robust to the inclusion of other types of ecological links, such as mutualism and interference competition, as long as consumer - resource interactions predominate. These considerations underscore the influence of food web structure on ecological dynamics and challenge the current view of interaction strength and long cycles as main drivers of stability in natural communities. ¬{\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

abstract = {Stick insects (Phasmida) are important herbivores in tropical ecosystems, but have been poorly investigated in their natural environment. We studied phasmids and their food plants in a tropical lowland rain forest in Borneo (Danum Valley, Sabah, Malaysia). Thirty species of phasmid were collected from 49 plant species during nocturnal surveys in the forest understorey. In most cases (35 plant species), experiments confirmed that these phasmids fed on those plant species from which they were collected. Partitioning of phasmid species among food plant species was highly significant. Two common species had a largely restricted diet: Asceles margaritatus occurred mainly on Mallotus spp. (Euphorbiaceae) and Dinophasma ruficornis on Leea indica (Leeaceae). Other phasmids fed on a broad spectrum of plant families and can be considered polyphagous (e.g. Haaniella echinata, Lonchodes hosei herberti). Feeding experiments were performed on captive phasmids using leaves from eight plant species. Asceles margaritatus showed a significantly higher consumption rate for Mallotus miquelianus leaves than for other plants, while H. echinata showed the opposite trend and the lowest consumption for M. miquelianus. However, A. margaritatus readily accepted foliage from several plant families, particularly when Mallotus was not offered at the same time. Therefore, studies on host specialisation by herbivores need to include their distribution in the natural vegetation.},

abstract = {Classical niche theory explains the coexistence of species through their exploitation of different resources. Assemblages of herbivores coexisting on a particular plant species are thus expected to be dominated by species from host-specific guilds with narrow, coexistence-facilitating niches rather than by species from generalist guilds. Exactly the opposite pattern is observed for folivores feeding on trees in New Guinea. The least specialized mobile chewers were the most species rich, followed by the moderately specialized semiconcealed and exposed chewers. The highly specialized miners and mesophyll suckers were the least species-rich guilds. The Poisson distribution of herbivore species richness among plant species in specialized guilds and the absence of a negative correlation between species richness in different guilds on the same plant species suggest that these guilds are not saturated with species. We show that herbivore assemblages are enriched with generalists because these are more completely sampled from regional species pools. Herbivore diversity increases as a power function of plant diversity, and the rate of increase is inversely related to host specificity. The relative species diversity among guilds is thus scale dependent, as the importance of specialized guilds increases with plant diversity. Specialized insect guilds may therefore comprise a larger component of overall diversity in the tropics (where they are also poorly known taxonomically) than in the temperate zone, which has lower plant diversity.},

We investigated the extent to which biomechanical traits are related to consumption in a plantgrasshopper herbivory network.

We quantified shear and punch toughness for each plant species, while grasshopper incisive and molar strengths were estimated by a lever mechanics model, following the measurement of mandibular traits. Models incorporating co-phylogenetic effects showed that the ratio between the grasshopper incisive strength and plant toughness, that reflects the cutting effort, is correlated with the mass of plant eaten. Moreover, a strong relationship between the incisive strength of the grasshoppers and the weighed mean toughness of the plants they eat was found. Our results suggest that biomechanical constraints imposed by plants influence the evolution of grasshoppers' mandibular traits. Such scaling relationships offer promising avenues towards the understanding of trait function links in interaction networks.},

@article{White1994,
abstract = {This paper generalizes Freeman's geodesic centrality measures for betweenness on undirected graphs to the more general directed case. Four steps are taken. The point centrality measure is first generalized for directed graphs. Second, a unique maximally centralized graph is defined for directed graphs, holding constant the numbers of points with reciprocatable (incoming and outgoing) versus only unreciprocatable (outgoing only or incoming only) arcs, and focusing the measure on the maximally central arrangement of arcs within these constraints. Alternatively, one may simply normalize on the number of arcs. This enables the third step of defining the relative betweenness centralities of a point, independent of the number of points. This normalization step for directed centrality measures removes Gould's objection that centrality measures for directed graphs are not interpretable because they lack a standard for maximality. The relative directed centrality converges with Freeman's betweenness measure in the case of undirected graphs with no isolates. The fourth step is to define the measures of this concept of graph centralization in terms of the dominance of the most central point. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {A wide variety of lepidopterans, bees, flies, and beetles visit the flowers of most species of New Zealand montane plants. Of the 82 plant species which were well-collected, 4 species (Pterostylis sp., Pratia macrodon, Mazus radicans, and Dracophyllum acerosum) exhibited specialised pollination relationships with an insect order; 3 species (Cyathodes fraserii, Microtis unifolia, and Thelymitra venosa) are “not apparently visited by insects; and the remaining 75 species are visited by a variety of insects in 2 or more orders. Introduced plant species in the Composite family are visited predominantly by introduced bumblebees. Bees in the genera Lasioglossum and Leioproctus are abundant flower visitors. The most common lepidopteran flower visitors are in the families Noctuidae, Geometridae, and Pyralidae, and the genus Lycaena. Dipterans, in particular tachinids and syrphids, are numerically the most abundant flower visitors, and visit a wide range of species. The syrphid Melangyna novaezelandiae visits the flowers of more plant species than any other flower visitor. Beetles are typically not abundant, and do not move often between flowers. Species in the genus Hebe might be expected to have different insect pollinators from species in the Composite family, because of the quite different floral characteristics in these groups. However, there is no general difference in the insects visiting the flowers in the genus Hebe, the family Compositae, and the remaining species, indicating a lack of specialisation for particular pollinators. Individual flowers of most species last more than 4 days, so that several consecutive days of bad weather need not prevent a flower from being pollinated. There is no obvious relationship between the biogeographical origin of plant species and the types of insects visiting its flowers.},

abstract = {The pollination ecology of tropical shrubland was studied in the Venezuelan Guayana Highlands. Most flowers are white or pink. Flower length is less than 0.5 cm for 45.4 percent of plant species (N = 55). The diameter has a similar distribution. Of the 62 visiting agents recorded on 55 plant species, 80.6 percent are pollinators and 19.4 percent are visitors only. Four families of bees are represented. Pollen is normally carried on only one location, frequently ventral, although it can also be carried on the head or legs. Pollen transportation by wasps (four families) is frequently ventral on the body and legs. Lepidopterans (three families) carry pollen grains on their proboscis. Coleopterans are represented by two species of Scarabaeidae which transport pollen ventrally. They as well as the dipterans visit only one plant species. Three bird species visit plant species in the shrubland. Politmus milleri (Trochilidae) pollinates seven plant species and the pollen is transported on the beak and head feathers. At the community level, 56.2 percent of plant species are pollinated by hymenopterans, 10.9 percent by lepidopterans and 9.6 percent by dipterans, and one plant species (2.7{\%}) by beetles. Bird-pollinated plants represent an important part of plants in the shrubland (12.3{\%}). The anemophilous plants are 8.2 percent of total. From 148 species of visitors recorded on 49 zoophilous plant species, 37.6 percent of plant species are pollinated by medium size bees, 16.9 percent by large bees and 10.1 percent by small bees. The small wasps pollinate 8.1 percent and large wasps pollinate 6.1 percent of plant species. Large flies visit 1.4 percent and small flies 2.7 percent of plant species.},

abstract = {Species composition and habitats are changing at unprecedented rates in the world's oceans, potentially causing entire food webs to shift to structurally and functionally different regimes. Despite the severity of these regime shifts, elucidating the precise nature of their underlying processes has remained difficult. We address this challenge with a new analytic approach to detect and assess the relative strength of different driving processes in food webs. Our study draws on complexity theory, and integrates the network-centric exponential random graph modelling (ERGM) framework developed within the social sciences with community ecology. In contrast to previous research, this approach makes clear assumptions of direction of causality and accommodates a dynamic perspective on the emergence of food webs. We apply our approach to analysing food webs of the Baltic Sea before and after a previously reported regime shift. Our results show that the dominant food web processes have remained largely the same, although we detect changes in their magnitudes. The results indicate that the reported regime shift may not be a system-wide shift, but instead involve a limited number of species. Our study emphasizes the importance of community-wide analysis on marine regime shifts and introduces a novel approach to examine food webs.},

abstract = {The assemblages of visitors to angiosperms flowering at a montane and at a high alpine site in the Andes of Mendoza, Argentina (33-34degreesS) were described and the plant-flower visitor matrices were analyzed and compared to other systems, in particular those located at a similar latitude on the western slope of the Andes. In the low-attitude (montane) habitat, 23 plant species had a total of 126 interactions with 71 taxa of insects and one hummingbird, and at the higher site 21 plants and 45 insect species had 83 interactions. Connectances of the visitor matrices were 7.6 and 8.7, respectively. Diptera and Hymenoptera dominated the visitor assemblages at both sites without change of proportions with attitude, while Lepidoptera significantly increased at the higher site. Flies were more species-rich than expected at the sites' latitude and more constant across altitudes than is usually observed. Lack of a significant decrease with altitude of (1) the frequency of Hymenoptera and (2) the number of interactions per plant were the main differences with a comparable gradient in the Chilean Andes. The proportion of self-compatible species increased with altitude, however. use of phylogenetically-independent contrasts showed that the prevalence of selfers at higher altitudes does not reflect a generalized reaction pattern but results from two speciose families (Asteraceae and Fabaceae) showing more self-compatibility at high altitudes.},

abstract = {1. In the Neotropics, most plants depend on animals for pollination. Solitary bees are the most important vectors, and among them members of the tribe Centridini depend on oil from flowers (mainly Malpighiaceae) to feed their larvae. This specialized relationship within 'the smallest of all worlds' (a whole pollination network) could result in a 'tiny world' different from the whole system. This 'tiny world' would have higher nestedness, shorter path lengths, lower modularity and higher resilience if compared with the whole pollination network. 2. In the present study, we contrasted a network of oil-flowers and their visitors from a Brazilian steppe ('caatinga') to whole pollination networks from all over the world. 3. A network approach was used to measure network structure and, finally, to test fragility. The oil-flower network studied was more nested (NODF = 0.84, N = 0.96) than all of the whole pollination networks studied. Average path lengths in the two-mode network were shorter (one node, both for bee and plant one-mode network projections) and modularity was lower (M = 0.22 and four modules) than in all of the whole pollination networks. Extinctions had no or small effects on the network structure, with an average change in nestedness smaller than 2{\%} in most of the cases studied; and only two species caused coextinctions. The higher the degree of the removed species, the stronger the effect and the higher the probability of a decrease in nestedness. 4. We conclude that the oil-flower subweb is more cohesive and resilient than whole pollination networks. Therefore, the Malpighiaceae have a robust pollination service in the Neotropics. Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that each ecological service is in fact a mosaic of different subservices with a hierarchical structure ('webs within webs').},

abstract = {The KwaZulu‐Natal region of South Africa hosts a large diversity of asclepiads (Apocynaceae: Asclepiadoideae), many of which are endemic to the area. The asclepiads are of particular interest because of their characteristically highly evolved floral morphology. During 3 months of fieldwork (November 2000 to January 2001) the flower visitors and pollinators to an assemblage of nine asclepiads at an upland grassland site were studied. These observations were augmented by laboratory studies of flower morphology (including scanning electron microscopy) and flower colour (using a spectrometer). Two of the specialized pollination systems that were documented are new to the asclepiads: fruit chafer pollination and pompilid wasp pollination. The latter is almost unique in the angiosperms. Taxa possessing these specific pollination systems cluster together in multidimensional phenotype space, suggesting that there has been convergent evolution in response to similar selection to attract identical pollinators. Pollination niche breadth varied from the very specialized species, with only one pollinator, to the more generalized, with up to ten pollinators. Pollinator sharing by the specialized taxa does not appear to have resulted in niche differentiation in terms of the temporal or spatial dimensions, or with regards to placement of pollinaria. Nestedness analysis of the data set showed that there was predictability and structure to the pattern of plant‐pollinator interactions, with generalist insects visiting specialized plants and vice versa. The research has shown that there is still much to be learned about plant–pollinator interactions in areas of high plant diversity such as South Africa.},

abstract = {Among-individual diet variation is common in natural populations and may occur at any trophic level within a food web. Yet, little is known about its variation among trophic levels and how such variation could affect phenotypic divergence within populations. In this study we investigate the relationships between trophic position (the population's range and average) and among-individual diet variation. We test for diet variation among individuals and across size classes of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), a widespread predatory freshwater fish that undergoes ontogenetic niche shifts. Second, we investigate among-individual diet variation within fish and invertebrate populations in two different lake communities using stable isotopes. Third, we test potential evolutionary implications of population trophic position by assessing the relationship between the proportion of piscivorous perch (populations of higher trophic position) and the degree of phenotypic divergence between littoral and pelagic perch sub-populations. We show that among-individual diet variation is highest at intermediate trophic positions, and that this high degree of among-individual variation likely causes an increase in the range of trophic positions among individuals. We also found that phenotypic divergence was negatively related to trophic position in a population. This study thus shows that trophic position is related to and may be important for among-individual diet variation as well as to phenotypic divergence within populations.},

@article{Fodrie2015,
abstract = {Many mobile marine species are presumed to utilize a broad spectrum of habitats, but this seemingly generalist life history may arise from conspecifics specializing on distinct habitat alternatives to exploit foraging, resting/refuge, or reproductive opportunities. We acoustically tagged 34 red drum, and mapped sand, seagrass, marsh, or oyster (across discrete landscape contexts) use by each uniquely coded individual. Using 144,000 acoustic detections, we recorded differences in habitat use among red drum: proportional use of seagrass habitat ranged from 0 to 100 {\%}, and use of oyster-bottom types also varied among fish. WIC/TNW and IS metrics (previously applied vis-{\`{a}}-vis diet specialization) consistently indicated that a typical red drum overlapped {\textgreater}70 {\%} with population-level niche exploitation. Monte Carlo permutations showed these values were lower than expected had fish drawn from a common habitat-use distribution, but longitudinal comparisons did not provide evidence of temporally consistent individuality, suggesting that differences among individuals were plastic and not reflective of true specialization. Given the range of acoustic detections we captured (from tens to 1,000s per individual), which are substantially larger sample sizes than in many diet studies, we extended our findings by serially reducing or expanding our data in simulations to evaluate sample-size effects. We found that the results of null hypothesis testing for specialization were highly dependent on sample size, with thresholds in the relationship between sample size and associated P-values. These results highlight opportunities and potential caveats in exploring individuality in habitat use. More broadly, exploring individual specialization in fine-scale habitat use suggests that, for mobile marine species, movement behaviors over shorter (≤weeks), but not longer (≥months), timescales may serve as an underlying mechanism for other forms of resource specialization.},

abstract = {The fundamental question of how complex life cycles--where there is typically more than one host-evolve in host--parasite systems remains largely unexplored. We suggest that complex cycles in helminths without penetrative infective stages evolve by two essentially different processes, depending on where in the cycle a new host is inserted. In 'upward incorporation', a new definitive host, typically higher up a food web and which preys on the original definitive host, is added. Advantages to the parasite are avoidance of mortality due to the predator, greater body size at maturity and higher fecundity. The original host typically becomes an intermediate host, in which reproduction is suppressed. In 'downward incorporation', a new intermediate host is added at a lower trophic level; this reduces mortality and facilitates transmission to the original definitive host. These two processes should also apply in helminths with penetrative infective stages, although the mathematical conditions differ.},

abstract = {In this study from Fjellfrosvatn, an oligotrophic lake in northern Norway, the parasite communities in two sympatric Arctic charr populations were compared. The dwarf morph, which inhabits the profundal zone, exhibited the lowest parasite diversity, seven species, and 72{\%} of these charr harboured only one or two parasite species. In contrast, 10 parasite species were encountered in the larger normal charr, and between 5 and 8 species were present in 73{\%} of these fish, which also utilised a broader food and habitat niche. Proteocephalus sp. was by far the most abundant species in the dwarf charr, probably because this morph fed intensively upon the benthic copepod Acanthocyclops gigas. On the other hand, parasites that are transmitted with littoral benthic prey (i.e., Phyllodistomum umblae, Cyathocephalus truncatus, Cystidicola farionis, and Crepidostomum spp.) were almost absent in the dwarf charr, though they were common in the normal morph. Also, Diphyllobothrium spp. were more prevalent in the normal charr, and this was attributed to their feeding upon limnetic copepods in the pelagic zone. The only recorded parasite with a direct life cycle, the copepod Salmincola edwardsii, had relatively similar abundances in the two morphs. The considerable differences in parasite community structure and abundance between the two charr populations were closely related to differences in the width and composition of the habitat and food niches between the morphs.},

abstract = {Individual niche specialization (INS) is increas- ingly recognized as an important component of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. However, most studies that have investigated INS have focused on the effects of niche width and inter- and intraspecific competition on INS in small-bodied species for short time periods, with less atten- tion paid to INS in large-bodied reptilian predators and the effects of available prey types on INS. We investigated the prevalence, causes, and consequences of INS in foraging behaviors across different populations of American alliga- tors (Alligator mississippiensis), the dominant aquatic apex predator across the southeast US, using stomach contents and stable isotopes. Gut contents revealed that, over the short term, although alligator populations occupied wide ranges of the INS spectrum, general patterns were apparent. Alligator populations inhabiting lakes exhibited lower INS than coastal populations, likely driven by variation in habi- tat type and available prey types. Stable isotopes revealed that over longer time spans alligators exhibited remark- ably consistent use of variable mixtures of carbon pools (e.g., marine and freshwater food webs). We conclude that INS in large-bodied reptilian predator populations is likely affected by variation in available prey types and habitat het- erogeneity, and that INS should be incorporated into man- agement strategies to efficiently meet intended goals. Also, ecological models, which typically do not consider behav- ioral variability, should include INS to increase model real- ism and applicability.},

@article{Marcogliese2002,
abstract = {Helminth parasites of fish in marine systems are often considered to be generalists, lacking host specificity for both intermediate and definitive hosts. In addition, many parasites in marine waters possess life cycles consisting of long-lived larval stages residing in intermediate and paratenic hosts. These properties are believed to be adaptations to the long food chains and the low densities of organisms distributed over broad spatial scales that are characteristic of open marine systems. Moreover, such properties are predicted to lead to the homogenization of parasite communities among fish species. Yet, these communities can be relatively distinct among marine fishes. For benthos, the heterogeneous horizontal distribution of invertebrates and fish with respect to sediment quality and water depth contributes to the formation of distinct parasite communities. Similarly, for the pelagic realm, vertical partitioning of animals with depth will lead to the segregation of parasites among fish hosts. Within each habitat, resource partitioning in terms of dietary preferences of fish further contributes to the establishment of distinct parasite assemblages. Parasite distributions are predicted to be superimposed on distributional patterns of free-living animals that participate as hosts in parasite life cycles. The purpose of this review is first, to summarize distribution patterns of invertebrates and fish in the marine environment and relate these patterns to helminth transmission. Second, patterns of transmission in marine systems are interpreted in the context of food web structure. Consideration of the structure and dynamics of food webs permits predictions about the distribution and abundance of parasites. Lastly, parasites that influence food web structure by regulating the abundance of dominant host species are briefly considered in addition to the effects of pollution and exploitation on food webs and parasite transmission.},

abstract = {Disease-mediated threats posed by exotic species to native counterparts are not limited to introduced parasites alone, since exotic hosts frequently acquire native parasites with possible consequences for infection patterns in native hosts. Several biological and geographical factors are thought to explain both the richness of parasites in native hosts, and the invasion success of free-living exotic species. However, the determinants of native parasite acquisition by exotic hosts remain unknown. Here, we investigated native parasite communities of exotic freshwater fish to determine which traits influence acquisition of native parasites by exotic hosts. Model selection suggested that five factors (total body length, time since introduction, phylogenetic relatedness to the native fish fauna, trophic level and native fish species richness) may be linked to native parasite acquisition by exotic fish, but 95{\%} confidence intervals of coefficient estimates indicated these explained little of the variance in parasite richness. Based on R2-values, weak positive relationships may exist only between the number of parasites acquired and either host size or time since introduction. Whilst our results suggest that factors influencing parasite richness in native host communities may be less important for exotic species, it seems that analyses of general ecological factors currently fail to adequately incorporate the physiological and immunological complexity of whether a given animal species will become a host for a new parasite.},

abstract = {Many populations consist of individuals that differ substantially in their diets. Quantification of the magnitude and temporal consistency of such intraspecific diet variation is needed to understand its importance, but the extent to which different approaches for doing so reflect instantaneous vs. time-aggregated measures of individual diets may bias inferences. We used direct observations of sea otter individuals (Enhydra lutris nereis) to assess how: (1) the timescale of sampling, (2) under-sampling, and (3) the incidence- vs. frequency-based consideration of prey species affect the inferred strength and consistency of intraspecific diet variation. Analyses of feeding observations aggregated over hourly to annual intervals revealed a substantial bias associated with time aggregation that decreases the inferred magnitude of specialization and increases the inferred consistency of individuals' diets. Time aggregation also made estimates of specialization more sensitive to the consideration of prey frequency, which decreased estimates relative to the use of prey incidence; time aggregation did not affect the extent to which under-sampling contributed to its overestimation. Our analyses demonstrate the importance of studying intraspecific diet variation with an explicit consideration of time and thereby suggest guidelines for future empirical efforts. Failure to consider time will likely produce inconsistent predictions regarding the effects of intraspecific variation on predator-prey interactions.},

abstract = {Many apparently generalized species are in fact composed of individual specialists that use a small subset of the population's resource distribution. Niche variation is usually established by testing the null hypothesis that individuals draw from a common resource distribution. This approach encourages a publication bias in which negative results are rarely reported, and obscures variation in the degree of individual specialization, limiting our ability to carry out comparative studies of the causes or consequences of niche variation. To facilitate studies of the degree of individual specialization, this paper outlines four quantitative indices of intrapopulation variation in resource use. Traditionally, such variation has been measured by partitioning the population's total niche width into within- and between-individual, sex, or phenotype components. We suggest two alternative measures that quantify the mean resource overlap between an individual and its population, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of all four measures. The utility of all indices depends on the quality of the empirical data. If resources are measured in a coarse-grained manner, individuals may falsely appear generalized. Alternatively, specialization may be overestimated by cross-sectional sampling schemes where diet variation can reflect a patchy environment. Isotope ratios, parasites, or diet–morphology correlations can complement cross-sectional data to establish temporal consistency of individual specialization.},

abstract = {The parasite communities of three coral-reef fish species (Stegastes nigricans, Dascyllus aruanus and Cephalopholis argus) were on Tiahura reef, French Polynesia. The age and growth of each fish was analysed by otolith increment counts and a significant correlation between these variables was found. Stegastes nigricans was parasitised by six adult parasite species, D. aruanus by two adult parasite species and C. argus by five adult parasite species. The most common parasite species were found in all fish size classes. Ectoparasites showed a positive relationship between their abundance and host body length for all three reef fish species. A positive relationship was found only between host size and parasite abundance for common endoparasite species. Parasite species richness, Brillouins diversity index, and host size and age were positively related. Finally, we discuss the influence of different biological (host diet, host immune response, parasite life-cycle) and ecological factors on parasite community structure in these three reef fishes. Host diet quality seems to be one of the major factors affecting the endoparasite community structure in these reef fishes. Ectoparasite communities seem to be influenced more by biological factors such as, for example, host immunity for the caligid larvae or parasite life-cycle for the gnathiid praniza larvae. In addition, the effect of ecological factors such as cleaning symbiosis on these ectoparasites cannot be dismissed. Copyright (C) 1998 Australian Society for Parasitology.},

abstract = {Shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) from Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, is a slow growing long-lived species. A wide range of diet items were present in the stomachs of the shorthorn sculpins sampled but 2-3 diet items (amphipod species) comprised 99.5{\%} of total food consumed, These amphipods were present in the stomachs in similar proportions among all age classes of shorthorn sculpin. Several new host records for parasites were reported and mean numbers of parasite species increased with shorthorn sculpin age. The increased diversity of parasite species and higher delta N-15 values in older/larger individuals suggest that their diets were more diverse and the prey items consumed had higher delta N-15 values. By contrast, the value of delta C-13 in dominant diet items masked the delta C-13 values of minor diet items. We conclude that parasites and stable isotope values provide complementary data on feeding patterns of the shorthorn sculpin. The ubiquitous marine acanthocephalan, Echinorhynchus gadi, was found at high prevalences (87-100{\%}) and mean intensities (28-35), and were localized in the midgut. In contrast to other studies on acanthocephalans, E. gadi did not influence fish condition as measured by condition factor, liver somatic and gonado-somatic indices.},

abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 948-958 ABSTRACT: Many generalist populations are composed of specialised individuals, whose niches are small subsets of the population niche. This 'individual specialisation' is a widespread phenomenon in natural populations, but until recently few studies quantified the magnitude of individual specialisation and how this magnitude varies among populations or contexts. Such quantitative approaches are necessary for us to understand how ecological interactions influence the amount of among-individual variation, and how the amount of variation might affect ecological dynamics. Herein, we review recent studies of individual specialisation, emphasising the novel insights arising from quantitative measures of diet variation. Experimental and comparative studies have confirmed long-standing theoretical expectations that the magnitude of among-individual diet variation depends on the level of intra and interspecific competition, ecological opportunity and predation. In contrast, there is little empirical information as to how individual specialisation affects community dynamics. We discuss some emerging methodological issues as guidelines for researchers studying individual specialisation, and make specific recommendations regarding avenues for future research.},

abstract = {The extent to which host biology, ecology and phylogeny determine the diversity of macroparasite assemblages has been investigated in recent years in several taxa, including fish. However, consensus has not been reached probably as a result of data being collected from different sources, different temporal scales or host and parasite biogeography and phylogeny having greater influence than expected. The present study evaluates the relative importance of 27 biological, ecological and phylogenetic characteristics of 14 flatfish species on the diversity of their ecto- and endoparasite assemblages, comprising a total of 53 taxa. Redundancy analyses were applied to the mean abundance of each parasite taxa infecting each host and to the richness, taxonomic distinctness and variance in taxonomic distinctness calculated for each assemblage within each host. Only a few host characteristics contributed significantly to the observed patterns: host distribution was more important in determining the type and mean abundance of ectoparasites present in an assemblage, whereas diversity of these assemblages were mainly related to the host's maximum size. Endoparasite mean abundance and diversity were mostly influenced by the number of food items ingested and by the presence of Crustacea and Polychaeta in the diet. However, the sympatric occurrence of related hosts also played an important role in the diversity values found in macroparasite assemblages. Results showed that a host characteristic has different importance according to the host-parasite relationship being examined, suggesting an important role for host-parasite co-evolution on the diversity of extant macroparasite assemblages.},

abstract = {Infection patterns of trophically transmitted helminth parasites were compared with feeding ecology in two sympatric whitefish Coregonus lavaretus morphs from two lake systems in northern Norway. In both lakes, the pelagic morph was an obligate zooplanktivore, while the benthic morph utilized both the benthivore and zooplanktivore trophic niches. The differences in niche utilization between the two morphs were associated with differences in trophic morphology (gill raker numbers), suggesting that they were genetically dissimilar and reproductively isolated. The benthic morph had the highest number of helminth species, probably because they exhibited a broader niche width compared to the pelagic morph. In both lakes, the species composition and intensities of helminths reflected the trophic diversification of the whitefish ecotypes with respect to different habitat choice (benthic v. pelagic) and dietary specialization (benthivore v. zooplanktivore feeding strategies within the benthic whitefish morph). Zooplanktivorous fish from both morphs acquired parasites mainly from pelagic copepods and in almost equal quantities. The benthivore feeders within the benthic morph had the highest proportion of parasites with transmission stages from benthic organisms. Host feeding behaviour seemed to be a major determinant of the helminth community structure, and helminths appeared to be useful indicators of long-term trophic specialization of whitefish ecotypes},

The highly significant correlation between morphometric and parasite canonical scores supports the hypothesis of functional diversification of individuals within lac Baie des Onze {\^{}} Iles. While fish from littoral and pelagic zones of lac Caribou did not differ in terms of diet, parasite assemblages or morphometrics, they were different to fish from lac Baie des Onze {\^{}} Iles in that they were less frequently infected with parasites that use gastropods as intermediate hosts, and had shorter pectoral fins.

Comparisons between the results of principal components analysis of head and mouth dimensions and the dietary compositions of Sillago bassensis , S. vittata , S. burrus , S. schomburgkii , S. robusta and Sillaginodespunctata suggests that any differences in the dietary composition of similar-sized representatives of different species, when they occur in the same habitat, are more likely to be due to differences in foraging behaviour than mouth morphology. Classification, ordination and Schoener's overlap indices showed that, in nearshore waters, the juveniles of Sillago bassensis , which colonise relatively exposed areas, have a different diet to those of the smallest representatives of the other whiting species that occupy more sheltered habitats. S. bassensis consumes mainly amphipods, whereas the smaller representatives of S. vittata , S. burrus , S. schomburgkii and Sillaginodes punctata ingest large volumes of copepods, which are typically abundant in protected nearshore waters. Although the mouth dimensions of S. punctata tend to be smaller than those of Sillago schomburgkii , the larger individuals of the former species ingest greater quantities of larger prey, such as crabs and carid shrimps. As S. bassensis , S. vittata and S. burrus increase in size and migrate out into shallow inner-shelf waters, the latter two species tend to concentrate more on benthic prey, while the former species ingests fauna that is more epibenthic. The largest S. bassensis subsequently migrate out into deep inner-shelf waters, where they co-occur with S. robusta , which is restricted to those waters. In these waters, S. bassensis feeds to a far greater extent on large benthic prey, whereas S. robusta consumes a greater quantity of small epibenthic crustaceans, differences that reflect the far larger lengths of the former species in that region. The above data emphasise that the distribution and ontogenetic movements of the six abundant species of whiting play a major role in facilitating a partitioning of food resources amongst these species found in coastal waters of the lower west coast of Australia.},

abstract = {Most empirical and theoretical studies of resource use and population dynamics treat conspecific individuals as ecologically equivalent. This simplification is only justified if interindividual niche variation is rare, weak, or has a trivial effect on ecological processes. This article reviews the incidence, degree, causes, and implications of individual-level niche variation to challenge these simplifications. Evidence for individual specialization is available for 93 species distributed across a broad range of taxonomic groups. Although few studies have quantified the degree to which individuals are specialized relative to their population, between-individual variation can sometimes comprise the majority of the population's niche width. The degree of individual specialization varies widely among species and among populations, reflecting a diverse array of physiological, behavioral, and ecological mechanisms that can generate intrapopulation variation. Finally, individual specialization has potentially important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications. Theory suggests that niche variation facilitates frequency-dependent interactions that can profoundly affect the population's stability, the amount of intraspecific competition, fitness-function shapes, and the population's capacity to diversify and speciate rapidly. Our collection of case studies suggests that individual specialization is a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon that poses many important but unanswered questions.},

abstract = {Recent studies of aquatic food webs show that parasite diversity is concentrated in nodes that likely favour transmission. Various aspects of parasite diversity have been observed to be correlated with the trophic level, size, diet breadth, and vulnerability to predation of hosts. However, no study has attempted to distinguish among all four correlates, which may have differential importance for trophically transmitted parasites occurring as larvae or adults. We searched for factors that best predict the diversity of larval and adult endoparasites in 4105 fish in 25 species studied over a three-year period in the Bothnian Bay, Finland. Local predator-prey relationships were determined from stomach contents, parasites, and published data in 8,229 fish in 31 species and in seals and piscivorous birds. Fish that consumed more species of prey had more diverse trophically transmitted adult parasites. Larval parasite diversity increased with the diversity of both prey and predators, but increases in predator diversity had a greater effect. Prey diversity was more strongly associated with the diversity of adult parasites than with that of larvae. The proportion of parasite species present as larvae in a host species was correlated with the diversity of its predators. There was a notable lack of association with the diversity of any parasite guild and fish length, trophic level, or trophic category. Thus, diversity is associated with different nodal properties in larval and adult parasites, and association strengths also differ, strongly reflecting the life cycles of parasites and the food chains they follow to complete transmission.},

A total of 36 specimens with lengths between 39.1 and 52.2 cm were sampled, which had taken 14 different prey items belonging to 4 major taxonomic groups (Chaetognatha, Crustacea, Mollusca and Teleostei). The most abundant prey organisms were Myctophidae and Euphausiacea, followed by Copepoda (Calanoida), Decapoda, Chaetognatha and Cephalopoda. Fishes were also the dominant prey in terms of biomass. Cannibalism was observed in 7 specimens of subadult L. caudatus. A total of 11 parasite species were identified in/on L. caudatus. We established 9 new host and 8 new locality records. Infestation rates were congruent with diet composition, indicating that parasites were ingested via mesopelagic prey organisms serving as intermediate hosts. The rich parasite fauna in L. caudatus reflects a high diversity of mesopelagic species at the GMS, providing niches for parasites and their intermediate hosts. While several species such as Paradiplectanotrema lepidopi (Monogenea) and Nybelinia lingualis (Cestoda) are typical parasites of L. caudatus, other species such as Sphyriocephalus tergestinus (Cestoda), Anisakis simplex (Nematoda) and Bolbosoma vasculosum (Acanthocephala) seem to be transferred by hosts migrating into the area, indicating an important role of the GMS in the transoceanic distribution patterns of such parasites},

For cestodes, larval digeneans, and gnathiid isopods, however, the mean correlation between fish length and intensity of infection was significant. Some statistical parameters influenced the strength of the raw correlations computed within samples and thus led to over- or under-estimation of the true relationship. Sample size correlated negatively with the value of the correlation coefficients, whereas range in both fish lengths and intensities of infection correlated positively with the value of the correlation coefficients.

abstract = {Effective management of our natural resources requires an understanding of ecosystem structure and function; effectively, an ecosystem-based approach to management. Parasites occur, albeit cryptically, in almost all ecosystems, yet they are usually neglected in studies on populations and communties of organisms. Parasites can have pronounced or subtle effects on hosts affecting host behavior, growth, fecundity, and mortality. Furthermore, parasites may regulate host population dynamics and influence community structure. Many parasites have complex life cycles and depend for transmission on the presence of a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate intermediate hosts. Often transmission involves predator–prey interactions. Thus, parasites reflect the host's position in the food web and are indicative of changes in ecosystem structure and function. Parasites can provide information on population structure, evolutionary hypotheses, environmental stressors, trophic interactions, biodiversity, and climatic conditions. I use examples from diverse freshwater and marine systems to demonstrate that parasites should be incorporated into research and monitoring programs to maximize information gathered in ecosystem-based studies and resource management.},

abstract = {The search for consistent patterns of organisation in parasite communities remains a central theme in parasite community ecology. However, to date, much evidence comes from studies without replication in both space and time; when replicate communities are examined, repeatable patterns are rarely observed. Here we determine, using nested subset analyses, whether the infracommunities of ectoparasites and endoparasites of a benthic marine fish (Sebastes capensis) show non-random structure. Then we examine the spatial repeatability of parasite community structure across the host's distribution in the southern Pacific, and the temporal repeatability of ectoparasite community structure from one locality. In total, 537 fish were captured from different latitudes (between 11??S and 52??S) along the Pacific coast of South America; a further 122 specimens were captured in two other years from one of the sampling localities, Valdivia (40??S). In spite of variation in fish sizes among samples, fish size generally did not correlate with either ecto- or endoparasite species richness. The ecto- and endoparasite species richness of the component communities were also not correlated with fish sample size across the nine localities. Significant nested patterns were found in the ectoparasite communities of S. capensis at all eight localities, except at latitude 52??S. Significant nested patterns were also found in the endoparasite infracommunities of S. capensis at seven of the nine localities, the exceptions being those from latitudes 11??S and 20??S. On a temporal scale, significant nestedness was observed in the ectoparasite infracommunities of S. capensis during each of the 3 years of sampling at Valdivia. In general, the same parasite species are responsible for the repeatability of nested patterns, though their importance varies among localities. The spatial and temporal predictability of the parasite community structure in S. capensis may be associated with the fish's benthic habitat and territorial behavior, suggesting that host biology may be a key determinant of the structure of parasite communities. ?? 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

abstract = {Parasites have been shown to reduce host density and to induce host population extinction in some cases but not in others. Epidemiological models suggest that variable effects of parasites on individual hosts can explain this variability on the population level. Here, we aim to support this hypothesis with a specific epidemiological model using a cross-parasite species approach. We compared the effect of six parasites on host fecundity and survival to their effects on density and risk of extinction of clonal host populations. We contrast our empirical results of population density with predictions from a deterministic model and contrast our empirical results of host and parasite extinction rates with those predicted by a stochastic model. Five horizontally transmitted microparasites (two bacteria: white bacterial disease, Pasteuria ramosa; two microsporidia: Glugoides intestinalis, Ordospora colligata; one fungus: Metschnikowiella biscuspidata); and six strains of a vertically transmitted microsporidium (Flabelliforma magnivora) of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna were used. In life table experiments, we quantified fecundity and survival in individual parasitized and healthy hosts and compared these with the effect of the parasites on host population density and on the likelihood of host population extinction in microcosm populations. Parasite species varied strongly in their effects on host fecundity, host survival, host density reduction, and the frequency with which they drove host populations to extinction. The fewer offspring an infected host produced, the lower the density of an infected host population. This effect on host density was relatively stronger for the vertically transmitted parasite strains than for the horizontally transmitted parasites. As predicted by the stochastic simulations, strong effects of a parasite on individual host survival and fecundity increased the risk of host population extinction. The same was true for parasite extinctions. Our results have implications for the use of microparasites in biological control programs and for the role parasites play in driving small populations to extinction.},

abstract = {Even though theoretical models show that parasites may regulate host population densities, few empirical studies have given support to this hypothesis. We present experimental and observational evidence for a host-parasite interaction where the parasite has sufficient impact on host population dynamics for regulation to occur. During a six year study of the Svalbard reindeer and its parasitic gastrointestinal nematode Ostertagia gruehneri we found that anthelminthic treatment in April-May increased the probability of a reindeer having a calf in the next year, compared with untreated controls. However, treatment did not influence the over-winter survival of the reindeer. The annual variation in the degree to which parasites depressed fecundity was positively related to the abundance of O. gruehneri infection the previous October, which in turn was related to host density two years earlier. In addition to the treatment effect, there was a strong negative effect of winter precipitation on the probability of female reindeer having a calf. A simple matrix model was parameterized using estimates from our experimental and observational data. This model shows that the parasite-mediated effect on fecundity was sufficient to regulate reindeer densities around observed host densities.},

However, such modularity is infrequent in seed dispersal networks, presumably because research on those networks predominantly includes a single taxonomic animal group (e.g. birds). Herein, for the first time, we examine the pattern of interaction in a network that includes multiple taxonomic groups of seed dispersers, and the mechanisms underlying modularity. We found that the network was nested and modular, with five distinguishable modules. Our examination of the mechanisms underlying such modularity showed that plant and animal trait values were associated with specific modules but phylogenetic effect was limited. Thus, the pattern of interaction in this network is only partially explained by shared evolutionary history. We conclude that the observed modularity emerged by a combination of phylogenetic history and trait convergence of phylogenetically unrelated species, shaped by interactions with particular types of dispersal agents.},

Although well-resolved ecological networks describe interaction frequencies between species pairs, modularity of bipartite networks has been analysed only on the basis of binary presence-absence data. We employ a new algorithm to detect modularity in weighted bipartite networks in a global analysis of avian seed-dispersal networks. We define roles of species, such as connector values, for weighted and binary networks and associate them with avian species traits and phylogeny. The weighted, but not binary, analysis identified a positive relationship between climatic seasonality and modularity, whereas past climate stability and phylogenetic signal were only weakly related to modularity. Connector values were associated with foraging behaviour and were phylogenetically conserved. The weighted modularity analysis demonstrates the dominating impact of ecological factors on the structure of seed-dispersal networks, but also underscores the relevance of evolutionary history in shaping species roles in ecological communities.},

abstract = {Predicting the dynamics of natural food webs requires estimates of the strength of interactions among species. The ability to estimate per capita interaction strength from observational data is desirable because of the logistical difficulty of using experimental manipulations to obtain such measures for all species within complex natural communities. In this paper, I derive observational measures of per capita interaction strength having units matching those of dynamic food web models (per capita consumption and assimilation rates). I also highlight the difference between per capita interaction strength (a parameter used in theoretical models) and species impact (empirical measures of total species effect). I then use behavioral observations and population censuses in a rocky intertidal community to estimate both per capita interaction strengths and species impacts on invertebrate prey of Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens), American Black Oystercatchers (Haema-topus bachmani), and Northwestern Crows (Corvus caurinus). Estimated per capita inter-action strengths exhibited a skewed distribution with many weak interactions and few strong interactions: mean Ϯ 1 SD of log 10 (interaction strength) ϭ Ϫ1.95 Ϯ 1.40 (bird-day/m of shore) Ϫ1 . Per capita interaction strength correlated poorly (r 2 ϭ 0.152–0.157) and nonlinearly with both consumption rates and percentage contribution of a prey species to the diet. Using my observational estimates of per capita interaction strengths, I predicted the species impact of bird predation on different prey taxa. Predictions included strong effects of birds on goose barnacles (Pollicipes polymerus), limpets (Lottia and Tectura spp.), sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus spp.), and large starfish (Pycnopodia helianthoides and Solaster stimp-soni), but little effect on mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. trossulus), dogwhelk snails (Nucella spp.), and acorn barnacles (Semibalanus cariosus). I compared nine of the pre-dictions with 126 results of experimental manipulations of birds. The predictions agreed both qualitatively and quantitatively with the experimental results. These findings suggest that observational measures of interaction strength that have units matching those of dy-namical food web models may be reasonable to use in estimating those found in natural communities.},

We show that in real food webs, interaction strengths are organized in trophic loops in such a way that long loops contain relatively many weak links. We show and explain mathematically that this patterning enhances stability, because it reduces maximum "loop weight" and thus reduces the amount of intraspecific interaction needed for matrix stability. The patterns are brought about by biomass pyramids, a feature common to most ecosystems. Incorporation of biomass pyramids in 104 food-web descriptions reveals that the low weight of the long loops stabilizes complex food webs. Loop-weight analysis could be a useful tool for exploring the structure and organization of complex communities.},

There is also a shift from viewing assemblages in terms of their contribution to particular processes toward placing them within a wider food web context. We review how the responses and predictors in B-EF experiments are quantified and how biodiversity effects are shaped by multitrophic interactions. Further, we discuss how B-EF metrics and food web relations could be addressed simultaneously.

While many publications try to elucidate patterns about the networks, others are primarily concerned with the role of specific species in the network. The core challenge here is to tell specialists from generalists. While field data and observations can be used to directly assess specialisation levels, the indirect way through networks is burdened with problems. Here, I review eight measures to quantify specialisation in pollination networks (degree, node specialisation, betweenness, closeness, strength, pollination support, Shannons H and discrimination d), the first four being based on binary, the others on weighted network data. All data and R-code are available as supplement and can be applied beyond pollination networks. The indices convey different concepts of specialisation and hence quantify different aspects. Still, there is some redundancy, with node specialisation and closeness quantifying the same properties, as do degree, betweenness and Shannons H. Using artificial and real network data, I illustrate the interpretation of the different indices and the importance of using a null model to correct for expectations given the different observed frequencies of interactions. For a well-described network the distributions of specialisation values do not differ from null model expectations for most indices. Finally, I investigate the effect of cattle grazing on the specialisation of an important pollinator in eight replicated pollination networks as an illustration of how to employ the specialisation indices, null models and permutation-based statistics in the analysis of specialisation in pollination networks.},

In particular, niche models are frequently over-interpreted: too often, they are based on limited occurrence data in high-dimensional environmental spaces, and cannot be interpreted robustly to indicate niche differentiation.},

abstract = {Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, has a simple pelagic food chain, and trophic relationships have been established previously from gut-content analysis. Instead of expected isotopic enrichment from phytoplankton to upper level consumers, there was a depletion of N-15 in August 1999. The isotope signatures of the lower trophic levels were an indicator of a recent upwelling event, identified by wind speed and nitrate concentration data, that occurred over a 4-d period several days prior to sampling. The isotope structure of the food web suggests that upwelled nitrate is a nutrient source rapidly consumed by phytoplankton, but the distinctive signature of this nitrate is diluted by time averaging in the upper trophic levels. This time averaging is a consequence of the fact that the isotopic signature of an organism is related to variable nitrogen sources used throughout the life of the organism. This study illustrates the importance of recognizing differences in time averaging among trophic levels.},

abstract = {The long-term consequences of climate change and potential environmental degradation are likely to include aspects of disease emergence in marine plants and animals. In turn, these emerging diseases may have epizootic potential, zoonotic implications, and a complex pathogenesis involving other cofactors such as anthropogenic contaminant burden, genetics, and immunologic dysfunction. The concept of marine sentinel organisms provides one approach to evaluating aquatic ecosystem health. Such sentinels are barometers for current or potential negative impacts on individual- and population-level animal health. In turn, using marine sentinels permits better characterization and management of impacts that ultimately affect animal and human health associated with the oceans. Marine mammals are prime sentinel species because many species have long life spans, are long-term coastal residents, feed at a high trophic level, and have unique fat stores that can serve as depots for anthropogenic toxins. Marine mammals may be exposed to environmental stressors such as chemical pollutants, harmful algal biotoxins, and emerging or resurging pathogens. Since many marine mammal species share the coastal environment with humans and consume the same food, they also may serve as effective sentinels for public health problems. Finally, marine mammals are charismatic megafauna that typically stimulate an exaggerated human behavioral response and are thus more likely to be observed.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analysis is a useful tool to track animal movements in both terrestrial and marine environments. These intrinsic markers are assimilated through the diet and may exhibit spatial gradients as a result of biogeochemical processes at the base of the food web. In the marine environment, maps to predict the spatial distribution of stable isotopes are limited, and thus determining geographic origin has been reliant upon integrating satellite telemetry and stable isotope data. Migratory sea turtles regularly move between foraging and reproductive areas. Whereas most nesting populations can be easily accessed and regularly monitored, little is known about the demographic trends in foraging populations. The purpose of the present study was to examine migration patterns of loggerhead nesting aggregations in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), where sea turtles have been historically understudied. Two methods of geographic assignment using stable isotope values in known-origin samples from satellite telemetry were compared: (1) a nominal approach through discriminant analysis and (2) a novel continuous-surface approach using bivariate carbon and nitrogen isoscapes (isotopic landscapes) developed for this study. Tissue samples for stable isotope analysis were obtained from 60 satellite-tracked individuals at five nesting beaches within the GoM. Both methodological approaches for assignment resulted in high accuracy of foraging area determination, though each has advantages and disadvantages. The nominal approach is more appropriate when defined boundaries are necessary, but up to 42{\%} of the individuals could not be considered in this approach. All individuals can be included in the continuous-surface approach, and individual results can be aggregated to identify geographic hotspots of foraging area use, though the accuracy rate was lower than nominal assignment. The methodological validation provides a foundation for future sea turtle studies in the region to inexpensively determine geographic origin for large numbers of untracked individuals. Regular monitoring of sea turtle nesting aggregations with stable isotope sampling can be used to fill critical data gaps regarding habitat use and migration patterns. Probabilistic assignment to origin with isoscapes has not been previously used in the marine environment, but the methods presented here could also be applied to other migratory marine species.},

Consequently, the number of studies using SIA in trophic ecology has increased exponentially over the past decade. Several subdisciplines have developed, including isotope mixing models, incorporation dynamics models, lipid-extraction and correction methods, isotopic routing models, and compound-specific isotopic analysis. As with all tools, there are limitations to SIA. Chief among these are multiple sources of variation in isotopic signatures, unequal taxonomic and ecosystem coverage, over-reliance on literature values for key parameters, lack of canonical models, untested or unrealistic assumptions, low predictive power, and a paucity of experimental studies. We anticipate progress in SIA resulting from standardization of methods and models, calibration of model parameters through experimentation, and continued development of several recent approaches such as isotopic routing models and compound-specific isotopic analysis.},

Here, we propose a means for quantifying functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of functional diversity “FD” is defined as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

Analyses showed that ferric iron reduction with depth was broadly accompanied by manganese and arsenic reduction and FeS accumulation. Clone library analyses indicated the suboxic-anoxic transition zone sediment contained abundant Fe(III)- and sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria, whereas the overlying surface sediment was dominated by clones related to the Fe(II)-oxidizing zetaproteobacterium, Mariprofundus ferroxydans. Cultures obtained from the transition zone were enriched in bacteria that reduced Fe(III), nitrate, sulfate and As(V) using acetate or lactate as electron donors. In the absence of added organic carbon, bacteria were enriched that oxidized Fe(II) anaerobically or microaerobically, sulfide microaerobically and aerobically and As(III) aerobically. According to 16S rRNA gene analyses, enriched bacteria represented a phylogenetically wide distribution. Most probable number counts indicated an abundance of nitrate-, As(V)- and Fe(III)((s,aq))-reducers, and dissolved sulfide-oxidizers over sulfate-reducers, and FeS-, As(III)- and nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidisers in the transition zone. It is noteworthy that the combined community and geochemical data imply near-surface microbial iron and arsenic redox cycling were dominant biogeochemical processes.},

However, the null distribution that QAP is based on is inappropriate for comparing subsamples of a data set and may lead to misleading conclusions. The new method can yield different results than QAP, results more in line with researchers' intuition.

abstract = {The algebraic definitions presented here are motivated by our search for an adequate formalization of the concepts of social roles as regularities in social network patterns. The theorems represent significant homomorphic reductions of social networks which are possible using these definitions to capture the role structure of a network. The concepts build directly on the pioneering work of S.F. Nadel (1957) and the pathbreaking approach to blockmodeling introduced by Lorrain and White (1971) and refined in subsequent years (White, Boorman and Breiger 1976;Boorman and White 1976; Arabie, Boorman and Levitt, 1978; Sailer, 1978). Blockmodeling is one of the predominant techniques for deriving structural models of social networks. When a network is represented by a directed multigraph, a blockmodel of the multigraph can be characterized as mapping points and edges onto their images in a reduced multigraph. The relations in a network or multigraph can also be composed to form a semigroup. In the first part of the paper we examine "graph" homomorphisms, or homomorphic mappings of the points or actors in a network. A family of basic concepts of role equivalence are introduced, and theorems presented to show the structure preserving properties of their various induced homomorphisms. This extends the "classic" approach to blockmodeling via the equivalence of positions. Lorrain and White (1971), Pattison (1980), Boyd (1980, 1982), and most recently Bonacich (1982) have explored the topic taken up in the second part of this paper, namely the homomorphic reduction of the semigroup of relations on a network, and the relation between semigroup and graph homomorphisms. Our approach allows us a significant beginning in reducing the complexity of a multigraph by collapsing relations which play a similar "role" in the network. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {Food webs, the networks describing "who eats whom" in an ecosystem, are nearly interval, i.e. there is a way to order the species so that almost all the resources of each consumer are adjacent in the ordering. This feature has important consequences, as it means that the structure of food webs can be described using a single (or few) species' traits. Moreover, exploiting the quasi-intervality found in empirical webs can help build better models for food web structure. Here we investigate which species trait is a good proxy for ordering the species to produce quasi-interval orderings. We find that body size produces a significant degree of intervality in almost all food webs analyzed, although it does not match the maximum intervality for the networks. There is also a great variability between webs. Other orderings based on trophic levels produce a lower level of intervality. Finally, we extend the concept of intervality from predator-centered (in which resources are in intervals) to prey-centered (in which consumers are in intervals). In this case as well we find that body size yields a significant, but not maximal, level of intervality. These results show that body size is an important, although not perfect, trait that shapes species interactions in food webs. This has important implications for the formulation of simple models used to construct realistic representations of food webs. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Simple probabilistic models for food web structure, however, are an exception as their likelihoods were recently derived. Here I test the performance of a more complex model for food web structure that is grounded in the allometric scaling of interactions with body size and the theory of optimal foraging (Allometric Diet Breadth Model-ADBM). This deterministic model has been evaluated by measuring the fraction of trophic relations it correctly predicts. I contrasted this value with that produced by simpler models based on body sizes and found that the quantitative information on allometric scaling and optimal foraging does not significantly increase model fit. Also, I present a method to compute the p-value for the fraction of trophic interactions correctly predicted by the ADBM, or any other model, with respect to three probabilistic models. I find that the ADBM predicts significantly more links than random graphs, but other models can outperform it. Although optimal foraging and allometric scaling may improve our understanding of food webs, the ADBM needs to be modified or replaced to find support in the data. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Structural or binary approaches, based on presence-absence of feeding links, are the most common method of assembling food webs and form the basis of the most well explored food web models. Binary approaches to assembling feeding links are often criticized as being less powerful and accurate than flow-based methods. To test this assumption we compared binary estimates of trophic position with estimates based on stable isotope values of nitrogen (d 15 N). For 366 species from eight marine and estuarine food webs we compared trophic position estimates based on binary ( presence-absence) feeding links with estimates based on the stable isotope of nitrogen (d 15 N). For a subset of 127 fish species in four of the webs we further compared trophic position estimates based on gut content analysis using a flow-based algorithm using data from FishBase.org with binary andd 15 N estimates. Across all species and webs binary estimates of trophic position were strongly correlated (R¼0.644) withd 15 N estimates. On average binary estimates differed from baseline correctedd 15 N estimates by 2.33{\%}for mean trophic position and 6.57{\%}for maximum trophic position. On average the difference between binaryd 15 N estimates was 0.14 of a trophic level. For the subset of 127 fish species binary estimates performed similarly or more accurately in predictingd 15 N values than the flow-based estimates. Binary approaches to assembling feeding links are often criticized as being less powerful and accurate than flow-based methods. Our results show a high concordance between binary andd 15 N estimates of trophic position as well as showing that in some cases binary estimates are better predictors ofd 15 N than flow-based estimates, reaffirming the robustness of the structural approach to assembling food webs. Additional cross-validation studies in other ecosystems are necessary to determine whether our results can be generalized to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.},

abstract = {The niche model has been widely used to model the structure of complex food webs, and yet the ecological meaning of the single niche dimension has not been explored. In the niche model, each species has three traits, niche position, diet position and feeding range. Here, a new probabilistic niche model, which allows the maximum likelihood set of trait values to be estimated for each species, is applied to the food web of the Benguela fishery. We also developed the allometric niche model, in which body size is used as the niche dimension. About 80{\%} of the links in the empirical data are predicted by the probabilistic niche model, a significant improvement over recent models. As in the niche model, species are uniformly distributed on the niche axis. Feeding ranges are exponentially distributed, but diet positions are not uniformly distributed below the predator. Species traits are strongly correlated with body size, but the allometric niche model performs significantly worse than the probabilistic niche model. The best-fit parameter set provides a significantly better model of the structure of the Benguela food web than was previously available. The methodology allows the identification of a number of taxa that stand out as outliers either in the model's poor performance at predicting their predators or prey or in their parameter values. While important, body size alone does not explain the structure of the one-dimensional niche.},

Despite this diversity, we demonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching and centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification of their architecture. First we show, for a diverse set of networks, that this decomposition provides an extremely tight fit to observed networks. Consequently, the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in partially known networks. Second, when node characteristics are known, we show how the matching-centrality decomposition can be related to this external information. Consequently, it offers a simple and versatile tool to explore how node characteristics explain network architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and flexibility of the model to forecast the links that a novel node would create if it were to join an existing network.},

abstract = {Understanding the structure of food webs, and the mechanisms that give rise to this structure, is one of the most challenging problems in ecology. We analyze from a statistical physics perspective the network structure of model food webs and of 15 community food webs from a variety of environments, including freshwater, marine, estuarine, and terrestrial environments. We perform a theoretical analysis of two recently proposed models for food webs, the niche model of R. J. Williams and N. D. Martinez and the nested-hierarchy model of M.-E Cattin et al. We find that the two models generate distributions of numbers of prey, predators, and links that are described by the same analytical expressions. Our analytical treatment reveals that a model's capacity to reproduce empirical data is principally determined by its ability to satisfy two conditions: (1) the species' niche values form a totally ordered set and (2) each species has a specific exponentially decaying probability of preying on a given fraction of the species with lower niche values. To test this hypothesis, we generalize the cascade model of J. E. Cohen and C. M. Newman so that it satisfies condition 2 and find that the new model is able to reproduce the properties of empirical food webs, validating our hypothesis. We use our analytical predictions as a guide to the analysis of 15 of the most complete empirical food webs available. We demonstrate that the quantitative unifying patterns that describe the properties of the food-web models considered earlier also describe the majority of the empirical webs considered. We find good agreement between the empirical data and the models for the average distance between species and the average clustering coefficient. Our results strongly support two hypotheses: first, that any model satisfying the two conditions we identify will accurately reproduce a number of the statistical properties of empirical food webs, and second, that the empirical distributions of number of prey and number of predators follow universal functional,forms that, without free parameters, match our analytical predictions.},

Network models range from the highly structured niche model to loosely constrained energetically feasible random networks. Bioenergetic models differ in how they represent primary production, functional responses, and consumption by generalists. Network structure weakly influenced the ability of species to coexist. Species persistence is strongly affected by functional responses and generalists' consumption rates but weakly affected by models and amounts of primary production. Despite these generalities, specific mechanisms that determine persistence under one dynamical regime, such as top-down control by consumers, may play an insignificant role under different dynamical conditions. Future research is needed to strengthen the weak empirical basis for various functional forms and parameter values that strongly influence whether species can coexist in complex food webs.},

abstract = {Floral phenotype and pollination system of a plant may be influenced by the abiotic environment and the local pollinator assemblage. This was investigated in seven plant-hummingbird assemblages on the West Indian islands of Grenada, Dominica and Puerto Rico. We report all hummingbird and insect pollinators of 49 hummingbird-pollinated plant species, as well as six quantitative and semi-quantitative floral characters that determine visitor restriction, attraction and reward. Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis, we show that hummingbird-pollinated plants in the West Indies separate in floral phenotypic space into two gradients—one associated with the abiotic environment and another with hummingbird size. Plants pollinated by large, long-billed hummingbirds had flowers with long corolla tube, large amounts of nectar and showy orange-red colouration. These attracted few or no insect species, whereas plants pollinated by small, short-billed hummingbirds were frequently pollinated by insects, particularly lepidopterans. The separation of plants related to environmental factors showed that species in the wet and cold highlands produced large amounts of dilute nectar, possessed no or a weak odour, and were associated with few insects, particularly few hymenopterans, compared to plants in the dry and warm lowlands. The most specialised hummingbird-pollinated plants are found in the West Indian highlands where they are pollinated by mainly large, long-billed hummingbirds. At the other extreme, highly generalised plants growing in the dry and warm lowlands are pollinated by small, short-billed hummingbirds and numerous insect species. This illustrates that, even within the hummingbird-pollinated flora, pollination syndrome and the degree of specialisation may vary tremendously depending on pollinator morphology and environment.},

abstract = {Many recent studies show that plant-pollinator interaction webs exhibit consistent structural features such as long-tailed distributions of the degree of generalization, nestedness of interactions and asymmetric interaction dependencies. Recognition of these shared features has led to a variety of mechanistic attempts at explanation. Here it is hypothesized that beside size thresholds and species abundances, the frequency distribution of sizes (nectar depths and proboscis lengths) will play a key role in determining observed interaction patterns. To test the influence of size distributions, a new network parameter is introduced: the degree of size matching between nectar depth and proboscis length. The observed degree of size matching in a Spanish plant-pollinator web was compared with the expected degree based on joint probability distributions, integrating size thresholds and abundance, and taking the sampling method into account. Nectar depths and proboscis lengths both exhibited right-skewed frequency distributions across species and individuals. Species-based size matching was equally close for plants, independent of nectar depth, but differed significantly for pollinators of dissimilar proboscis length. The observed patterns were predicted well by a model considering size distributions across species. Observed size matching was closer when relative abundances of species were included, especially for flowers with openly accessible nectar and pollinators with long proboscises, but was predicted somewhat less successfully by the model that included abundances. The results suggest that in addition to size thresholds and species abundances, size distributions are important for understanding interaction patterns in plant-pollinator webs. It is likely that the understanding will be improved further by characterizing for entire communities how nectar production of flowers and energetic requirements of pollinators covary with size, and how sampling methods influence the observed interaction patterns.},

abstract = {* Biotic interactions do not occur in isolation but are imbedded in a network of species interactions. Network analysis facilitates the compilation and understanding of the complexity found in natural ecosystems and is a powerful tool to reveal information on the degree of specialization of the interacting partners and their niches. The indices measuring these properties are based on qualitative or quantitative observations of interactions between partners from different trophic levels, which informs about the structure of network patterns, but not about the underlying mechanisms. Functional traits may control the interaction strength between partners and also the (micro-) structure of networks. Here, we ask whether flower visitors specialize on certain plant traits and how this trait specialization contributes to niche partitioning and interaction partner diversity. * We introduce two novel statistical approaches suited to evaluate the dimension of the realized niche and to analyse which traits determine niches. As basis for our analysis, we measured 10 quantitative flower traits and evaluated whether 31 arthropod taxa i visited flowers displaying only subsets of the available trait characteristics, indicating a specialization on these traits by narrow trait-widths 〈Si〉. The product of 10 trait- and species-specific trait-widths 〈Si〉 was defined as trait-volume Vi (expansion of a n-dimensional hypervolume) occupied by each taxon i. These indices are applicable beyond flower–visitor interactions to quantify realized niches based on various biotic and abiotic factors. * Each flower visitor species showed some degree of specialization to a unique set of flower traits (realized niche). Overall, our data suggested a hierarchical sequence of flower traits influencing the flower visitors' behaviour and thus network structure: flowering phenology was found to have the strongest effect, followed by flower height, nectar-tube depth and floral reflectance. Less important were pollen-mass/flower, sugar/flower, anther position, phylogeny, display size and abundance. * The species-specific specialization on traits suggests that plant communities with more diverse floral niches may sustain a larger number of flower visitors with non-redundant fundamental niches. Our study and statistical approach provide a basis for a better understanding of how plant traits shape interactions between flowers and their visitors and thus network structure.},

abstract = {Ecological communities are organized in complex ecological networks. Trait-based analyses of the structure of these networks in highly diversified species assemblages are crucial for improving our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes causing specialization in mutualistic networks. In this study, we assessed the importance of morphological traits for structuring plant–hummingbird networks in Neotropical forests by using a novel combination of quantitative analytical approaches. We recorded the visitation of hummingbirds to plant species over an entire year at three different elevations in Costa Rica and constructed quantitative networks based on interaction frequencies. Three morphological traits were measured in hummingbirds (bill length, bill curvature, and body mass) and plants (corolla length, curvature, and volume). We tested the effects of avian morphological traits and abundance on ecological specialization of hummingbird species. All three morphological traits of hummingbirds were positively associated with ecological specialization, especially bill curvature. We tested whether interaction strength in the networks was associated with the degree of trait matching between corresponding pairs of morphological traits in plant and hummingbird species and explore whether this was related to resource handling times by hummingbird species. We found strong and significant associations between interaction strength and the degree of trait matching. Moreover, the degree of trait matching, particularly between bill and corolla length, was associated with the handling time of nectar resources by hummingbirds. Our findings show that bill morphology structures tropical plant–hummingbird networks and patterns of interactions are closely associated with morphological matches between plant and bird species and the efficiency of hummingbirds' resource use. These results are consistent with the findings of seminal studies in plant–hummingbird systems from the neotropics. We conclude that trait-based analyses of quantitative networks contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of the causes of specialization in ecological networks and could be valuable for studying processes of complementary trait evolution in highly diversified species assemblages.

abstract = {Thirty-two species of commercially important fish from three trophic levels and nine trophic categories were sampled at a floodplain lake of the Solim{\~{o}}es River (Lago Grande de Manacapuru). The fish were analyzed to determine their Hg level and the bioaccumulation, bioconcentration, and biomagnification of this element. The observed increase in mean concentration of mercury (49.6 ng.g-1 for omnivores, 418.3 ng.g-1 for piscivores, and 527.8 ng.g-1 for carnivores/necrophages) furnished evidence of biomagnification. Primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers presented biomagnification factors of 0.27, 0.33, and 0.47, respectively. Significant differences in the bioconcentration and concentration of total Hg occurred between the categories of the third trophic level and the other categories. Plagioscion squamosissimus (carnivorous/piscivorous) and Calophysus macropterus (carnivorous/ necrophagous) showed levels of total Hg above those permitted by Brazilian law (500 ng.g-1 ). Six other species also posed risks to human health because their Hg levels exceeded 300 ng.g-1 . Fifteen species showed bioaccumulation, but only eight presented significant correlations between the concentration of Hg and the length and/or the weight of the fish.},

abstract = {The long-term consequences of climate change and potential environmental degradation are likely to include aspects of disease emergence in marine plants and animals. In turn, these emerging diseases may have epizootic potential, zoonotic implications, and a complex pathogenesis involving other cofactors such as anthropogenic contaminant burden, genetics, and immunologic dysfunction. The concept of marine sentinel organisms provides one approach to evaluating aquatic ecosystem health. Such sentinels are barometers for current or potential negative impacts on individual- and population-level animal health. In turn, using marine sentinels permits better characterization and management of impacts that ultimately affect animal and human health associated with the oceans. Marine mammals are prime sentinel species because many species have long life spans, are long-term coastal residents, feed at a high trophic level, and have unique fat stores that can serve as depots for anthropogenic toxins. Marine mammals may be exposed to environmental stressors such as chemical pollutants, harmful algal biotoxins, and emerging or resurging pathogens. Since many marine mammal species share the coastal environment with humans and consume the same food, they also may serve as effective sentinels for public health problems. Finally, marine mammals are charismatic megafauna that typically stimulate an exaggerated human behavioral response and are thus more likely to be observed.},

Under the 'latitude-niche breadth hypothesis', which predicts that species in the tropics will tend to evolve narrower niches, one might expect that these scaling relationships could also be affected by latitude. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the scaling relationships between species richness and average generality, vulnerability and links per species across a set of 196 empirical food webs. In estuarine, marine and terrestrial food webs there was no effect of latitude on any scaling relationship, suggesting constant niche breadth in these habitats. In freshwater communities, on the other hand, there were strong effects of latitude on scaling relationships, supporting the latitude-niche breadth hypothesis. These contrasting findings indicate that it may be more important to account for habitat than latitude when exploring gradients in food-web structure.},

Here, we analyzed a 29-year phenological data set comprising community-level information on the timing and span of temporal occurrence in 11 seasonally occurring animal taxon groups from 329 local meteorological observatories across China. We show that widespread shifts in phenology have resulted in community-wide changes in the temporal overlap between taxa that are dominated by extensions, and that these changes are largely due to taxa's altered span of temporal occurrence rather than the degree of synchrony in phenological shifts. Importantly, our findings also suggest that climate change may have led to less phenological mismatch than generally presumed, and that the context under which to discuss the ecological consequences of phenological shifts should be expanded beyond asynchronous shifts.},

@article{Gezon2016,
abstract = {Climate change has had numerous ecological effects, including species range shifts and altered phenology. Altering flowering phenology often affects plant reproduction, but the mechanisms behind these changes are not well-understood. To investigate why altering flowering phenology affects plant reproduction, we manipulated flowering phenology of the spring herb Claytonia lanceolata (Portulacaceae) using two methods: in 2011-2013 by altering snow pack (snow-removal vs. control treatments), and in 2013 by inducing flowering in a greenhouse before placing plants in experimental outdoor arrays (early, control, and late treatments). We measured flowering phenology, pollinator visitation, plant reproduction (fruit and seed set), and pollen limitation. Flowering occurred approx. 10 days earlier in snow-removal than control plots during all years of snow manipulation. Pollinator visitation patterns and strength of pollen limitation varied with snow treatments, and among years. Plants in the snow removal treatment were more likely to experience frost damage, and frost-damaged plants suffered low reproduction despite lack of pollen limitation. Plants in the snow removal treatment that escaped frost damage had higher pollinator visitation rates and reproduction than controls. The results of the array experiment supported the results of the snow manipulations. Plants in the early and late treatments suffered very low reproduction due either to severe frost damage (early treatment) or low pollinator visitation (late treatment) relative to control plants. Thus, plants face tradeoffs with advanced flowering time. While early-flowering plants can reap the benefits of enhanced pollination services, they do so at the cost of increased susceptibility to frost damage that can overwhelm any benefit of flowering early. In contrast, delayed flowering results in dramatic reductions in plant reproduction through reduced pollination. Our results suggest that climate change may constrain the success of early-flowering plants not through plant-pollinator mismatch but through the direct impacts of extreme environmental conditions.},

The historic network showed flexibility in response to disturbance; however, our data suggest that networks will be less resilient to future changes.},

abstract = {Many taxa of parasites modify the behavior of their hosts in ways that improve their probability of transmission. Regardless of its evolutionary origins or underlying mechanisms, host manipulation is a widespread adaptive strategy yielding fitness benefits for parasites with various life cycles and transmission modes. This chapter focuses on recent developments that are expanding our understanding of this phenomenon. Currently, growing attention is being paid to the effect of parasites on whole suites of host behavioral traits as opposed to single traits, and to correlations among behaviors, which may be the target of manipulation instead of the traits themselves. At the same time, variation in the use of manipulation is being explored both among and within parasite species. On the one hand, models that take into account the potential costs of manipulation predict under what circumstances manipulation is likely to evolve as a transmission strategy. On the other hand, within manipulative species, manipulation may be a flexible strategy only adopted by individual parasites in certain conditions dictated by other parasites and by the host itself. This inter- and intraspecific variation in the use of host manipulation for transmission is due in large part to its unreliable effectiveness within complex natural systems where dead-ends await many manipulative parasites. Finally, recent neurological and proteomic studies of the pathways used by parasites to alter host behavior offer new insights into the evolution of manipulation. The chapter ends with a list of promising directions that provide an agenda for future research.},

@article{Whittaker1972,
abstract = {Given a resource gradient (e.g. light intensity, prey size) in a community, species evolve to use different parts of this gradient; competition between them is thereby reduced. Species relationships in the community may be conceived in terms of a multidimensional coordinate system, the axes of which are the various resource gradients (and other aspects of species relationships to space, time, and one another in the community). This coordinate system defines a hyperspace, and the range of the space that a given species occupies is its niche hypervolume, as an abstract characterization of its intra-community position, or niche. Species evolve toward difference in niche, and consequently toward difference in location of their hypervolumes in the niche hyperspace. Through evolutionary time addi- tional species can fit into the community in niche hypervolumes different from those of other species, and the niche hyperspace can become increasingly complex. Its complexity relates to the community's richness in species, its alpha diversity. Species differ in the proportions of the niche hyperspace they are able to occupy and the share of the community's resources they utilize. The share of resources utilized is expressed in species' productivities, and when species are ranked by relative productivity (or some other measurement) from most to least important, importance-value or domi- nance-diversity curves are formed. Three types of curves may represent manners in which resources are divided among species: (a) niche pre-emption with strong dominance, expressed in a geometric series, (b) random boundaries between niches, expressed in the MacArthur distribution, and (c) determination of relative importance by many factors, so that species form a frequency distribution on a logarithmic base of importance values, a lognormal distribution. The forms of importance-value curves do not permit strong infer- ence about resource division, but are of interest for their expression of species relation- ships and bearing on measurement of diversity. Two aspects of alpha diversity are to be measured. Diversity in the strict sense is richness in species, and is appropriately measured as the number of species in a sample of standard size. Slope measurements, in contrast, express the steepness of the importance- value sequence. Of the slope measurements the Simpson index expresses dominance or relative concentration of the importance values into the first or first few species, whereas the Shannon-Wiener index expresses the relative evenness or equitability of the importance values through the whole sequence. A new index, expressing equitability as number of species per logarithmic cycle of the importance-value sequence, is suggested. Given a habitat gradient (e.g. elevation or soil moisture conditions) species evolve to occupy different positions along this gradient. The various habitat gradients of a landscape may also be conceived as a multidimensional hyperspace, and species evolve toward occupa- tion of different positions in this hyperspace. Along a particular habitat gradient species populations have scattered centers and usually overlap broadly, forming a community continuum or coenocline. Through evolutionary time additional species can fit themselves in along the coenocline. As they do so the extent of change in community composition along the gradient increases. The extent of differentiation of communities along habitat gradients is beta diversity. The total or gamma diversity of a landscape, or geographic area, is a product of the alpha diversity of its communities and the degree of beta differentiation among them. The species' position in a landscape of communities, as described in terms of both habitat and niche relationships, may be termed its ecotope. Two approaches to measuring beta diversity have been most useful. For a transect along a given coenocline, the degree of species turnover or compositional change may be measured through sample similarities and expressed as half-changes. When a set of samples are taken to represent differences in communities of a landscape or range of habitat along more than one habitat axis, beta differentiation for these samples may be expressed by the ratio of the total number of species represented in the samples to the mean number per sample. Diversity of communities seems a resultant of non-extreme conditions, stable condi- tions, evolutionary and successional time, and the kind of community developed in that time. It is difficult to separate the effects of chronic environmental rigor, amplitude of regular fluctuation, and irregularity or unpredictableness of fluctuation. Diversities are low in many unstable environments, but certain desert communities subject to wide and irregular variation in precipitation have evolved high diversities in relation to this varia- tion. Evolutionary time is difficult to measure, but is important as the dimension through which increase in alpha and beta diversity occurs. Alpha diversities of birds, and gamma diverstities of islands, appear to reach saturation or steady-state levels. It is suggested, however, that for terrestrial plants and insects increase of species diversity, with elabora- tion of the niche hyperspace and division of the habitat hyperspace, is a self-augmenting evolutionary process without any evident limit.},

abstract = {Abstract Saurochory (seed dispersal by reptiles) among crocodilians has largely been ignored, probably because these reptiles are generally assumed to be obligate carnivores incapable of digesting vegetable proteins and polysaccharides. Herein we review the literature on crocodilian diet, foraging ecology, digestive physiology and movement patterns, and provide additional empirical data from recent dietary studies of Alligator mississippiensis. We found evidence of frugivory in 13 of 18 (72.2{\%}) species for which dietary information was available, indicating this behav- ior is widespread among the Crocodylia. Thirty-four families and 46 genera of plants were consumed by crocodilians. Fruit types consumed by crocodilians varied widely; over half (52.1{\%}) were fleshy fruits. Some fruits are consumed as gastroliths or ingested incidental to prey capture; however, there is little doubt that on occasion, fruit is deliberately consumed, often in large quantities. Sensory cues involved in crocodilian frugivory are poorly understood, although airborne and waterborne cues as well as surface disturbances seem important. Crocodilians likely accrue nutritional benefits from frugivory and there are no a priori reasons to assume otherwise. Ingested seeds are regurgitated, retained in the stomach for indefinite and often lengthy periods, or passed through the digestive tract and excreted in feces. Chemical and mechanical scarification of seeds probably occurs in the stomach, but what effects these processes have on seed viability remain unknown. Because crocodilians have large territories and undertake lengthy movements, seeds are likely transported well beyond the parent plant before being voided. Little is known about the ultimate fate of seeds ingested by crocodilians; however, however, deposition sites could prove suitable for seed germination. Although there is no evidence for a crocodilian-specific dispersal syndrome similar to that described for other reptiles, our review strongly suggests that crocodilians func- tion as effective agents of seed dispersal. Crocodilian saurochory offers a fertile ground for future research.},

Interpre- tation of these data remains, however, a major scientiﬁc chal- lenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks1–3. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate that we can ﬁnd functional mod- ules4,5 in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a ‘cartographic represen- tation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks6–8 are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability9. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We ﬁnd that, typically, 80{\%} of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we ﬁnd that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

abstract = {Past trends and future projections of key atmospheric, oceanic, sea ice, and biogeochemical variables were assessed to increase our understanding of climate change impacts on Canadian Arctic marine ecosystems. Four subbasins are evaluated: Beaufort Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Baffin Bay/Davis Strait, and Hudson Bay Complex. Limited observations, especially for ecosystem variables, compromise the trend analyses. Future projections are predominately from global models with few contributions from available marine basin scale models. The assessment indicates a significant increase in air temperature, slight increases in precipitation and snow depth, and appreciable changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. Projections suggest an increase in storm strength and size, leading to enhanced storm surges and coastal erosion, a slight increase in wave heights, increases in gustiness, and small changes in mean wind speed. An Arctic-wide decrease in the extent of multiyear ice and a spatial and temporal increase in ice-free waters in summer have been observed and are projected to continue into the future. Limited observations of ocean properties show local freshening (Beaufort Sea) and summer warming (Baffin Bay). These trends are projected to continue along with localized strengthening in stratification. Increased ocean acidification has been observed and is projected to continue throughout the Canadian Arctic, leading to severely decreased saturation states of calcium carbonate (aragonite and calcite). Qualitative analysis of biological observations indicate large regional differences. Increased primary production and double bloom development is seen in areas of sea ice retreat where nutrient supply is sufficient, and unchanged or reduced production is seen where nutrients are low or suppressed in response to enhanced stratification. Future primary production projections show inconsistent results, with light-dependent increase or nutrient-limited decrease dominating, dependent on the model. For the next decade, natural intradecadal variability is expected to be of similar importance as longer-term trends. To improve our capacity to assess and project climate change adaptation in marine ecosystems, more consistent observations are needed, especially over marine areas and for biogeochemical variables. Higher resolution basin-scale models are also required to provide locally applicable projections relevant for Arctic communities and management units.},

abstract = {We reviewed empirical data and hypotheses derived from demographic, optimal foraging, life-history, community, and biogeographic theory for predicting the sensitivity of species to habitat fragmentation. We found 12 traits or trait groups that have been suggested as predictors of species sensitivity: population size; population fluctuation and storage effect; dispersal power; reproductive potential; annual survival; sociality; body size; trophic position; ecological specialisation, microhabitat and matrix use; disturbance and competition sensitive traits; rarity; and biogeographic position. For each trait we discuss the theoretical justification for its sensitivity to fragmentation and empirical evidence for and against the suitability of the trait as a predictor of fragmentation sensitivity. Where relevant, we also discuss experimental design problems for testing the underlying hypotheses. There is good empirical support for 6 of the 12 traits as sensitivity predictors: population size; population fluctuation and storage effects; traits associated with competitive ability and disturbance sensitivity in plants; microhabitat specialisation and matrix use; rarity in the form of low abundance within a habitat; and relative biogeographic position. Few clear patterns emerge for the remaining traits from empirical studies if examined in isolation. Consequently, interactions of species traits and environmental conditions must be considered if we want to be able to predict species sensitivity to fragmentation. We develop a classification of fragmentation sensitivity based on specific trait combinations and discuss the implications of the results for ecological theory.},

It is, however, usually difficult to distinguish changes caused by a changing climate from other factors. 2. Forestry is considered to be the major disturbance factor in Swedish forests. Here, we use forest lake data sets from 1996 and 2006 which include species abundance data for dragonfly larvae, water plant structure, forest age and forestry measures during a period of 25 years: from 1980 to 2005. Hence, we were able to discriminate between forestry effects and changes in species composition driven by recent climate change. 3. We explored effects on regional species composition, species abundance and ecosystem functions, such as changes in niche use, utilising dragonflies (Odonata) as model organisms. 4. Our results show that dragonflies react rapidly to climate change, showing strong responses over such a short time span as 10 years. We observed changes in both species composition and abundance; former rare species have become more frequent and now occur in lakes of a wider quality range, while former widespread species have become more selective in their choice of waters. The new communities harbour about the same number of species as before, but seen from a regional perspective, diversity is reduced. 5. We predict that the altered species composition and abundance might raise new demands in conservation planning as well as altering the ecological functions of the aquatic systems.},

abstract = {Stream fish are expected to be significantly influenced by climate change, as they are ectothermic animals whose dispersal is limited within hydrographic networks. Nonetheless, they are also controlled by other physical factors that may prevent them moving to new thermally suitable sites. Using presence-absence records in 655 sites widespread throughout nine French river units, we predicted the potential future distribution of 30 common stream fish species facing temperature warming and change in precipitation regime. We also assessed the potential impacts on fish assemblages' structure and diversity. Only cold-water species, whose diversity is very low in French streams, were predicted to experience a strong reduction in the number of suitable sites. In contrast, most cool-water and warm-water fish species were projected to colonize many newly suitable sites. Considering that cold headwater streams are the most numerous on the Earth's surface, our results suggested that headwater species would undergo a deleterious effect of climate change, whereas downstream species would expand their range by migrating to sites located in intermediate streams or upstream. As a result, local species richness was forecasted to increase greatly and high turnover rates indicated future fundamental changes in assemblages' structure. Changes in assemblage composition were also positively related to the intensity of warming. Overall, these results (1) stressed the importance of accounting for both climatic and topographic factors when assessing the future distribution of riverine fish species and (2) may be viewed as a first estimation of climate change impacts on European freshwater fish assemblages. {\textordfeminine} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textordfeminine} 2008 Blackwell Publishing},

Here, we argue that multiple anthropogenic pressures - including land-use intensification, climate change, and the spread of alien species and diseases - are primarily responsible for insect-pollinator declines. We show that a complex interplay between pressures (eg lack of food sources, diseases, and pesticides) and biological processes (eg species dispersal and interactions) at a range of scales (from genes to ecosystems) underpins the general decline in insect-pollinator populations. Interdisciplinary research on the nature and impacts of these interactions will be needed if human food security and ecosystem function are to be preserved. We highlight key areas that require research focus and outline some practical steps to alleviate the pressures on pollinators and the pollination services they deliver to wild and crop plants.},

Here, we illustrate how human-altered landscapes, with novel ornamental and crop plant communities, result not only in changes to local community diversity of floral-dependent species, but also in shifts in seasonal abundance of bee pollinators. Three years of data on the spatio-temporal distributions of 91 bee species show that seasonal patterns of abundance and species richness in human-altered landscapes varied significantly less compared to natural habitats in which floral resources are relatively scarce in the dry summer months. These findings demonstrate that anthropogenic environmental changes in urban and agricultural systems, here mediated through changes in plant resources and water inputs, can alter the temporal dynamics of pollinators that depend on them. Changes in phenology of interactions can be an important, though frequently overlooked, mechanism of global change.},

abstract = {Plant-animal mutualisms are characterized by weak or asymmetric mutual dependences between interacting species, a feature that could increase community stability. If invasive species integrate into mutualistic webs, they may alter web structure, with consequences for species persistence. However, the effect of alien mutualists on the architecture of plant-pollinator webs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the extent of mutual dependency between interacting species, as a measure of mutualism strength, and the connectivity of 10 paired plant-pollinator webs, eight from forests of the southern Andes and two from oceanic islands, with different incidences of alien species. Highly invaded webs exhibited weaker mutualism than less-invaded webs. This potential increase in network stability was the result of a disproportionate increase in the importance and participation of alien species in the most asymmetric interactions. The integration of alien mutualists did not alter overall network connectivity, but links were transferred from generalist native species to super-generalist alien species during invasion. Therefore, connectivity among native species declined in highly invaded webs. These modifications in the structure of pollination webs, due to dominance of alien mutualists, can leave many native species subject to novel ecological and evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {A central issue in ecology is the definition and identification of keystone species, i.e. species that are relatively more important than others for maintaining community structure and ecosystem functioning. Network theory has been pointed out as a robust theoretical framework to enhance the operationality of the keystone species concept. We used the concept of centrality as a proxy for a species ' relative importance for the structure of seed dispersal networks composed of either frugivorous bats or birds and their food-plants. Centrality was expected to be determined mainly by dietary specialization, but also by body mass and geographic range size. Across 15 Neotropical datasets, only specialized frugivore species reached the highest values of centrality. Furthermore, the centrality of specialized frugivores varied widely within and among networks, whereas that of secondary and opportunistic frugivores was consistently low. A mixed-eff ects model showed that centrality was best explained by dietary specialization, but not by body mass or range size. Furthermore, the relationship between centrality and those three ecological correlates diff ered between bat – and bird – fruit networks. Our findings suggest that dietary specialization is key to understand what makes a frugivore species a keystone in seed dispersal networks, and that taxonomic identity also plays a signifi cant role. Specialized frugivores may play a central role in network structuring and ecosystem functioning, which has important implications for conservation and restoration.},

abstract = {Interaction strength (IS) has been theoretically shown to play a major role in governing the stability and dynamics of food webs. Nonetheless, its definition has been varied and problematic, including a range of recent definitions based on biological rates associated with model parameters (e.g., attack rate). Results from food web theory have been used to argue that IS metrics based on energy flux ought to have a clear relationship with stability. Here, we use simple models to elucidate the actual relationship between local stability and a number of common IS metrics (total flux and per capita fluxes) as well as a more recently suggested metric. We find that the classical IS metrics map to stability in a more complex way than suggested by existing food web theory and that the new IS metric has a much clearer, and biologically interpretable, relationship with local stability. The total energy flux metric falls off existing theoretical predictions when the total resource productivity available to the consumer is reduced despite increased consumer attack rates. The density of a consumer can hence decrease when its attack rate increases. This effect, called the paradox of attack rate, is similar to the well-known hydra effect and can even cascade up a food chain to exclude a predator when consumer attack rate is increased.},

abstract = {Conservation biology should focus more on the importance rather than the rarity of species, although the definition and quantification of importance are not easy. One approach involves measuring the positional importance (e.g. centrality) of species in ecological interaction networks to provide a basis for species ranking. However, there are many centrality indices, each reflecting a particular aspect of positional importance and therefore giving a rank order of species different from those provided by alternative formulations. Thus, there is a strong need for comparing the available indices and for examining their relative merits in network analysis. In this paper, we apply 13 centrality indices to the "species" (trophic components) of methodologically comparable trophic flow networks, in order to answer the following questions: (1) What is the disagreement between different indices regarding the rank of a given species in a given network? (2) How is this disagreement in performance influenced by the choice of the network? (3) What is the overall relationship among these indices and, in particular, which are the most similar to degree (the simplest index of all, being equal to the number of links pertaining to a given node)? We compare the 13 indices based on the data of nine networks using metric and rank statistics and multivariate analysis procedures. We conclude that (1) different centrality ranks differ in each network; (2) different webs can be characterized by different relationships between ranks but there is a robust pattern of relationships among the indices, some index pairs behaving very similarly in all networks; and (3) it is the index of closeness centrality which provides a rank most similar to that based on degree. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

They are often used to quantify the degree of specialization between partners, but usually based on qualitative indices such as 'connectance' or number of links. These measures ignore interaction frequencies or sampling intensity, and strongly depend on network size.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we introduce two quantitative indices using interaction frequencies to describe the degree of specialization, based on information theory. The first measure (d') describes the degree of interaction specialization at the species level, while the second measure (H2') characterizes the degree of specialization or partitioning among two parties in the entire network. Both indices are mathematically related and derived from Shannon entropy. The species-level index d' can be used to analyze variation within networks, while H2' as a network-level index is useful for comparisons across different interaction webs. Analyses of two published pollinator networks identified differences and features that have not been detected with previous approaches. For instance, plants and pollinators within a network differed in their average degree of specialization (weighted mean d'), and the correlation between specialization of pollinators and their relative abundance also differed between the webs. Rarefied sampling effort in both networks and null model simulations suggest that H2' is not affected by network size or sampling intensity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Quantitative analyses reflect properties of interaction networks more appropriately than previous qualitative attempts, and are robust against variation in sampling intensity, network size and symmetry. These measures will improve our understanding of patterns of specialization within and across networks from a broad spectrum of biological interactions.},

abstract = {Nature is organized into complex, dynamical networks of species and their interactions, which may influence diversity and stability. However, network research is, generally, short-term and depict ecological networks as static structures only, devoid of any dynamics. This hampers our understanding of how nature responds to larger disturbances such as changes in climate. In order to remedy this we studied the long-term (12-yrs) dynamics of a flower-visitation network, consisting of flower-visiting butterflies and their nectar plants. Global network properties, i.e. numbers of species and links, as well as connectance, were temporally stable, whereas most species and links showed a strong temporal dynamics. However, species of butterflies and plants varied bimodally in their temporal persistance: Sporadic species, being present only 1-2(-5) years, and stable species, being present (9-)11-12 years, dominated the networks. Temporal persistence and linkage level of species, i.e. number of links to other species, made up two groups of species: Specialists with a highly variable temporal persistence, and temporally stable species with a highly variable linkage level. Turnover of links of specialists was driven by species turnover, whereas turnover of links among generalists took place through rewiring, i.e. by reshuffling existing interactions. However, in spite of this strong internal dynamics of species and links the network appeared overall stable. If this global stability-local instability phenomenon is general, it is a most astonishing feature of ecological networks.},

abstract = {The short summers of the High Arctic pose a strong time constraint on the annual cycle of all organisms in this region. Although arctic arthropods can complete their development at very low temperatures, the predicted climatic changes may shift their phenology outside its normal range. Hence, arctic arthropods may become exposed to conditions to which they are not adapted. On the basis of long-term data from several plots of pitfall and window traps at Zackenberg in high-arctic Northeast Greenland, we document that the timing of emergence is closely related to date of snowmelt in nine taxa of common surface-active and flying arthropods. Average air temperature seemed to play a lesser role, although the duration from snowmelt to the date when 50{\%} of the individuals in the season were caught (date50) was negatively related to the average daily air temperature during the same time interval in three of the nine taxa. Since short-term weather fluctuations appeared to have a small effect on capture numbers in pitfall and window traps, we suggest that timing of snowmelt is a good predictor of the phenology of most arthropods in high-arctic Greenland. The spatial synchrony of capture numbers between individual traps within plots was high. However, among pairs of plots, the spatial synchrony varied between taxa and habitats and declined with distance between plots for surface-dwelling taxa and with difference in timing of snowmelt for the most abundant families of Diptera (Muscidae and Chironomidae). Detritus feeders (collembolans, mites and most larvae of Diptera) and predators (spiders of the families Linyphiidae and Lycosidae) were abundant throughout the summer season. In contrast, the abundance of more specialized groups, like butterflies (e.g., Nymphalidae) and parasitoid wasps (e.g., Ichneumonidae), was restricted to a narrow seasonal time window in the warmest part of the summer. Because of their narrow phenological range and their host specialization, these taxa may be most vulnerable to trophic mismatch. Furthermore, snowmelt is predicted to become more variable, and this may affect organisms in areas of late snowmelt most severely. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A sharp rainfall gradient occurs between the two sites located 80 km apart. The wetter forest is located in San Lorenzo Protected Area on the Caribbean side of the isthmus, and the drier forest is a part of the Parque Natural Metropolitano close to Panama City on the Pacific slope. Host specificity was measured as effective specialization and recorded by probability methods based on abundance categories and feeding records from a total of 102 species of trees and lianas equally distributed between the two sites. The total material collected included more than 65,000 beetles of 2462 species, of which 306 species were shared between the two sites. The wet forest was 37{\%} more species rich than the dry forest due to more saproxylic species and flower visitors. Saproxylic species and flower visitors were also more host-specific in the wet forest. Leaf chewers showed similar levels of species richness and host specificity in both forests. The effective number of specialized species per plant species was higher in the wet forest. Higher levels of local alpha- and beta-diversity as well as host specificity based on present data from a tropical wet forest, suggests higher number of species at regional levels, a result that may have consequences for ecological estimates of global species richness.},

abstract = {The high arctic is undergoing a faster change in climate than most other regions of the planet, with already observed ecological consequences. Combined with the characteristics of high-arctic ecosystems, such as low species redundancy, high seasonality and weather extremes, shifts in individual species performance and phenology may lead to altered interaction dynamics through trophic mismatch and cascades. An ecosystem approach is therefore desirable in the attempt to understand the multidimensional impacts of climate. Here, we present ecosystem-wide trend analyses of a long-term dataset on terrestrial and limnic biota with focus on the distribution of observed trends and associated variation across the ecosystem. We used 114 time series drawn from 11 abiotic variables, 19 terrestrial and 7 limnic biotic species/taxa and compared temporal trends, changes and abrupt shifts in the variation within and across the two biota. A total of 36 {\%} of the time series analysed showed a significant trend during the study period with a higher frequency of trends occurring within performance variables. Overall, the changes tended to be negative, indicating advances in phenology but reduced species performance. General system variance was also higher in the limnic biota than in the terrestrial biota, both exhibiting increasing variance up through the trophic system. Overall, our results suggest that multiple biotic responses to the climatic changes in this high-arctic ecosystem are not synchronised across trophic levels and may differ qualitatively and quantitatively between terrestrial and limnic biota. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Plants are flowering earlier in response to climate change. However, substantial interannual variation in phenology may make it difficult to discern and compare long-term trends. In addition to providing insight on data requirements for discerning such trends, phenological shifts within subsets of long-term records will provide insight into the mechanisms driving changes in flowering over longer time scales.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: To examine variation in flowering shifts among temporal subsets of long-term records, we used two data sets of flowering phenology from snow-dominated habitats: subalpine meadow in Gothic, Colorado, USA (38 yr), and arctic tundra in Zackenberg, Greenland (16 yr). Shifts in flowering time were calculated as 10-yr moving averages for onset, peak, and end of flowering.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Flowering advanced over the course of the entire time series at both sites. Flowering shifts at Gothic were variable, with some 10-yr time frames showing significant delays and others significant advancements. Early-flowering species were more responsive than later-flowering species, while the opposite was true at Zackenberg. Flowering shifts at Zackenberg were less variable, with advanced flowering across all 10-yr time frames. At both sites, long-term advancement seemed to be primarily driven by strong advancements in flowering in the 1990s and early 2000s.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Analysis of long-term trends can mask substantial variation in phenological shifts through time. This variation in the direction and magnitude of phenological shifts has implications for the evolution of flowering time and for interspecific interactions with flowering plants and can provide more detailed insights into the dynamics of phenological responses to climate change.},

abstract = {Identifying important species for maintaining ecosystem functions is a challenge in ecology. Since species are components of food webs, one way to conceptualize and quantify species importance is from a network perspective. The importance of a species can be quantified by measuring the centrality of its position in a food web, because a central node may have greater influence on others in the network. A species may also be important because it has a unique network position, such that its loss cannot be easily compensated. Therefore, for a food web to be robust, we hypothesize that central species must be functionally redundant in terms of their network position. In this paper, we test our hypothesis by analysing the Prince William Sound ecosystem. We found that species centrality and uniqueness are negatively correlated, and such an observation is also carried over to other food webs.},

Selection among systemic configurations or patterns that differ in their intrinsic stability should lead generally to increased representation of relatively stable structures. Such nonadaptive, but selective processes that shape ecological communities offer an enticing mechanism for generating widely observed similarities, and have sparked new interest in stability properties. This nonadaptive systemic selection operates not in opposition to, but in parallel with, adaptive evolution.},

abstract = {Understanding what maintains species and perpetuates their coexistence in a network of feeding relationships (the food web) is of great importance for biodiversity conservation. A food web can be viewed as consisting of a number of simple subunits called trophic modules. Intraguild predation (IGP), in which a prey and its predator compete for the same resource, is one of the best-studied trophic modules. According to theory, there are two ways to yield a large persistent system from such modules: () to use persistent subunits as building blocks or () to arrange the subunits in a way that externally supports the nonpersistent subunits. Here, I show that the complex food web of the Caribbean marine ecosystem is constructed in both ways. I show that IGP modules, which convey internal persistence because of the fact that prey are superior competitors for the resources, are overrepresented in the Caribbean ecosystem. The other modules, consisting of competitively inferior prey, are not persistent in isolation. However, competitively inferior prey in these modules tend to receive more advantage from extra-module interactions, which allows persistence of the IGP module. In addition, those exterior interactions tend to be provided by intrinsically persistent IGP modules to prevent cascading extinction of interacting IGP modules. The food web can be viewed as a set of interacting modules, nonrandomly arranged to enhance the maintenance of biodiversity},

abstract = {Interspecific interactions reflect the cumulative consequences of individual behavioral acts. The foraging decisions made by predators influence the way in which predation shapes the structure of prey communities. Alternative prey species co-occurring in a patch embedded in a matrix of many similar patches may interact through a shared mobile predator in two distinct ways. First, the functional response by an individual predator foraging in the patch to one prey species may be affected by the density of a second prey species in the patch (e.g., any time spent handling one prey reduces the time available for capturing other prey). Second, the presence of a second prey species may alter the propensity of predators to aggregate or remain in a given patch. We argue that this aggregative numerical response can in many circumstances generate -, - interactions (apparent competition) between prey species that otherwise would not interact. This is most likely if predators use a simple optimality criterion for prey selectivity within patches and the marginal-value theorem for deciding when to enter and leave patches. By contrast, if predators have suboptimal diets within patches but leave in accord with the marginal-value theorem, alternative prey may experience a +, - interaction; and, if predators use patches independently of prey availability, a +, + interaction between alternative prey can occur. Hence, the qualitative character of the interaction between alternative prey in a patchy environment depends on the degree to which predators do, or do not, match the canonical predictions of optimal foraging theory.

The first algorithm, REGE, is well known, but has not previously been described in the literature. The second algorithm, CATREGE, is new. Whereas REGE is applicable to quantitative data, CATREGE is used for categorical data. For binary data, either algorithm may be used, though the CATREGE algorithm is significantly faster and its output similarity coefficients have better metric properties. The CATREGE algorithm is also useful pedagogically, because it is easier to grasp. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {How many dimensions (trait-axes) are required to predict whether two species interact? This unanswered question originated with the idea of ecological niches, and yet bears relevance today for understanding what determines network structure. Here, we analyse a set of 200 ecological networks, including food webs, antagonistic and mutualistic networks, and find that the number of dimensions needed to completely explain all interactions is small ( {\textless} 10), with model selection favouring less than five. Using 18 high-quality webs including several species traits, we identify which traits contribute the most to explaining network structure. We show that accounting for a few traits dramatically improves our understanding of the structure of ecological networks. Matching traits for resources and consumers, for example, fruit size and bill gape, are the most successful combinations. These results link ecologically important species attributes to large-scale community structure.},

abstract = {Food webs depict who eats whom in communities. Ecologists have examined statistical metrics and other properties of food webs, but mainly due to the uneven quality of the data, the results have proved controversial. The qualitative data on which those efforts rested treat trophic interactions as present or absent and disregard potentially huge variation in their magnitude, an approach similar to analyzing traffic without differentiating between highways and side roads. More appropriate data are now available and were used here to analyze the relationship between trophic complexity and diversity in 59 quantitative food webs from seven studies (14-202 species) based on recently developed quantitative descriptors. Our results shed new light on food-web structure. First, webs are much simpler when considered quantitatively, and link density exhibits scale invariance or weak dependence on food-web size. Second, the "constant connectance" hypothesis is not supported: connectance decreases with web size in both qualitative and quantitative data. Complexity has occupied a central role in the discussion of food-web stability, and we explore the implications for this debate. Our findings indicate that larger webs are more richly endowed with the weak trophic interactions that recent theories show to be responsible for food-web stability.},

abstract = {Species extinctions are biased towards higher trophic levels, and primary extinctions are often followed by unexpected secondary extinctions. Currently, predictions on the vulnerability of ecological communities to extinction cascades are based on models that focus on bottom-up effects, which cannot capture the effects of extinctions at higher trophic levels. We show, in experimental insect communities, that harvesting of single carnivorous parasitoid species led to a significant increase in extinction rate of other parasitoid species, separated by four trophic links. Harvesting resulted in the release of prey from top-down control, leading to increased interspecific competition at the herbivore trophic level. This resulted in increased extinction rates of non-harvested parasitoid species when their host had become rare relative to other herbivores. The results demonstrate a mechanism for horizontal extinction cascades, and illustrate that altering the relationship between a predator and its prey can cause wide-ranging ripple effects through ecosystems, including unexpected extinctions.},

It is widely believed that this is a general phenomenon for marine food webs. An analysis of 148 papers with biomagnification in the title shows that under half show biomagnification. Of studies on metals only organic mercury shows biomagnification and most metals are regulated and excreted and do not biomagnify. Of the studies on organic compounds 67{\%} claimed to show biomagnification. However, bioconcentration (uptake from the surrounding water) is the most usual way that organic compounds are accumulated in organisms from invertebrates to and including fish. Only in sea-birds and marine mammals is food intake the major route and where biomagnification can be clearly shown. Body concentrations of organic compounds vary with lipid content and thus in order to compare across species normalisation to uniform lipid content should be done. Yet often this is not done so data purporting to show biomagnification merely relate to differing lipid content in the different species studied. Finally suggestions are made as to how data can be collected to better interpret the process of biomagnification in marine food webs. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Mercury exposure may be linked to several sources of variation related to habitat conditions and species ecology. In generalist birds, feeding habits may change quickly in response to environmental conditions, prey availability and individual requirements. Stable nitrogen isotope ratios (15N) were used as a marker of trophic level, and stable carbon isotope ratios ( 13C) as a marker of carbon sources (terrestrial vs. marine) in food webs involving waterbirds, to infer the effect on mercury exposure due to differences in feeding ecology and the relative dependence on aquatic environments. Four generalist species occupying three different habitats were examined during the breeding season. Habitats: Brackish water - saltwater (saltpans), brackish water - freshwater (ricefields and some saltpans) and terrestrial environment (steppes). Species: Avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), Black-winged Stilt (Himantopus himantopus), Kentish Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) and Cattle Egret (Bulbucus ibis). Chick feathers were collected at several locations between 2000 and 2003. Species used resources differently in the environment, and distinct pathways were involved in the mobilization of mercury into food webs. The positive relationship between feather 15N values and mercury levels indicated mercury bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Inter-specific variation in feather 13C values revealed a different relative dependence among species on terrestrial vs. aquatic prey. Intra-specific variation in feather 13C values also indicated differential use of marine inputs within each species, and within saltpans for Avocet chicks. Feather mercury levels and 13C values suggested that the relative use of marine-derived prey influences mercury levels in chicks.},

Studies assessing the role of invertebrate abundance and behavior as controls on food web structure are rare at the whole ecosystem scale. Here we use a comparative approach to investigate bottom--up and top--down influences on whole anchialine pond ecosystems in coastal Hawai`i. In these ponds, a single species of endemic atyid shrimp (Halocaridina rubra) is believed to structure epilithon communities. Many Hawaiian anchialine ponds and their endemic fauna, however, have been greatly altered by bottom--up (increased nutrient enrichment) and top--down (introduced fish predators) disturbances from human development. We present the results of a survey of dissolved nutrient concentrations, epilithon biomass and composition, and H. rubra abundance and behavior in anchialine ponds with and without invasive predatory fish along a nutrient concentration gradient on the North Kona coast of Hawai`i. We use linear models to assess 1) the effects of nutrient loading and fish introductions on pond food web structure and 2) the role of shrimp density and behavior in effecting that change. We find evidence for bottom--up food web control, in that nutrients were associated with increased epilithon biomass, autotrophy and nutrient content as well as increased abundance and size of H. rubra. We also find evidence for top--down control, as ponds with invasive predatory fish had higher epilithon biomass, productivity, and nutrient content. Top--down effects were transmitted by both altered H. rubra abundance, which changed the biomass of epilithon, and H. rubra behavior, which changed the composition of the epilithon. Our study extends experimental findings on bottom--up and top--down control to the whole ecosystem scale and finds evidence for qualitatively different effects of trait- and density-mediated change in top--down influences.},

abstract = {Apex predators and plant resources are both critical for maintaining diversity in biotic communities, but the indirect ('cascading') effects of top-down and bottom-up forces on diversity at different trophic levels are not well resolved in terrestrial systems. Manipulations of predators or resources can cause direct changes of diversity at one trophic level, which in turn can affect diversity at other trophic levels. The indirect diversity effects of resource and consumer variation should be strongest in aquatic systems, moderate in terrestrial systems, and weakest in decomposer food webs. We measured effects of top predators and plant resources on the diversity of endophytic animals in an understorey shrub Piper cenocladum (Piperaceae). Predators and resource availability had significant direct and indirect effects on the diversity of the endophytic animal community, but the effects were not interactive, nor were they consistent between living vs. detrital food webs. The addition of fourth trophic level beetle predators increased diversity of consumers supported by living plant tissue, whereas balanced plant resources (light and nutrients) increased the diversity of primary through tertiary consumers in the detrital resources food web. These results support the hypotheses that top-down and bottom-up diversity cascades occur in terrestrial systems, and that diversity is affected by different factors in living vs. detrital food webs.},

The elimination rate constants of DDT by the copepods were comparable following uptake from the diet and from the water. Elimination of DDT from the fish was exceedingly low.

abstract = {The late Pleistocene extinction of so many large-bodied vertebrates has been variously attributed to two general causes: rapid climate change and the effects of humans as they spread from the Old World to previously uninhabited continents and islands. Many large-bodied vertebrates, especially large apex predators, maintain their associated ecosystems through top-down forcing processes, especially trophic cascades, and megaherbivores also exert an array of strong indirect effects on their communities. Thus, a third possibility for at least some of the Pleistocene extinctions is that they occurred through habitat changes resulting from the loss of these other keystone species. Here we explore the plausibility of this mechanism, using information on sea otters, kelp forests, and the recent extinction of Steller's sea cows from the Commander Islands. Large numbers of sea cows occurred in the Commander Islands at the time of their discovery by Europeans in 1741. Although extinction of these last remaining sea cows during early years of the Pacific maritime fur trade is widely thought to be a consequence of direct human overkill, we show that it is also a probable consequence of the loss of sea otters and the co-occurring loss of kelp, even if not a single sea cow had been killed directly by humans. This example supports the hypothesis that the directly caused extinctions of a few large vertebrates in the late Pleistocene may have resulted in the coextinction of numerous other species.},

abstract = {1. The loss of a species from an ecological community can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions. Here we investigate how the complexity (connectance) of model communities affects their response to species loss. Using dynamic analysis based on a global criterion of persistence (permanence) and topological analysis we investigate the extent of secondary extinctions following the loss of different kinds of species. 2. We show that complex communities are, on average, more resistant to species loss than simple communities: the number of secondary extinctions decreases with increasing connectance. However, complex communities are more vulnerable to loss of top predators than simple communities. 3. The loss of highly connected species (species with many links to other species) and species at low trophic levels triggers, on average, the largest number of secondary extinctions. The effect of the connectivity of a species is strongest in webs with low connectance. 4. Most secondary extinctions are due to direct bottom-up effects: consumers go extinct when their resources are lost. Secondary extinctions due to trophic cascades and disruption of predator-mediated coexistence also occur. Secondary extinctions due to disruption of predator-mediated coexistence are more common in complex communities than in simple communities, while bottom-up and top-down extinction cascades are more common in simple communities. 5. Topological analysis of the response of communities to species loss always predicts a lower number of secondary extinctions than dynamic analysis, especially in food webs with high connectance.},

abstract = {Top predator losses affect a wide array of ecological processes, and there is growing evidence that top predators are disproportionately vulnerable to environmental changes. Despite increasing recognition of the fundamental role that top predators play in structuring communities and ecosystems, it remains challenging to predict the consequences of predator extinctions in highly variable environments. Both biotic and abiotic drivers determine community structure, and manipulative experiments are necessary to disentangle the effects of predator loss from other co-occurring environmental changes. To explore the consistency of top predator effects in ecological communities that experience high local environmental variability, we experimentally removed top predators from arid-land stream pool mesocosms in southeastern Arizona, USA, and measured natural background environmental conditions. We inoculated mesocosms with aquatic invertebrates from local streams, removed the top predator Abedus herberti (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae) from half of the mesocosms as a treatment, and measured community divergence at the end of the summer dry season. We repeated the experiment in two consecutive years, which represented two very different biotic and abiotic environments. We found that some of the effects of top predator removal were consistent despite significant differences in environmental conditions, community composition, and colonist sources between years. As in other studies, top predator removal did not affect overall species richness or abundance in either year, and we observed inconsistent effects on community and trophic structure. However, top predator removal consistently affected large-bodied species (those in the top 1{\%} of the community body size distribution) in both years, increasing the abundance of mesopredators and decreasing the abundance of detritivores, even though the identity of these species varied between years. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of large taxa to top predator extirpations and suggest that the consistency of observed ecological patterns may be as important as their magnitude.},

abstract = {The large vulnerability of top predators to human-induced disturbances on ecosystems is a matter of growing concern. Because top predators often exert strong influence on their prey populations their extinction can have far-reaching consequences for the structure and functioning of ecosystems. It has, for example, been observed that the local loss of a predator can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions. However, the time lags involved in such secondary extinctions remain unexplored. Here we show that the loss of a top predator leads to a significantly earlier onset of secondary extinctions in model communities than does the loss of a species from other trophic levels. Moreover, in most cases time to secondary extinction increases with increasing species richness. If local secondary extinctions occur early they are less likely to be balanced by immigration of species from local communities nearby. The implications of these results for community persistence and conservation priorities are discussed.},

abstract = {Top predator loss is a major global problem, with a current trend in biodiversity loss towards high trophic levels that modifies most ecosystems worldwide. Most research in this area is focused on large-bodied predators, despite the high extinction risk of small-bodied freshwater fish that often act as apex consumers. Consequently, it remains unknown if intermittent streams are affected by the consequences of top-predators' extirpations. The aim of our research was to determine how this global problem affects intermittent streams and, in particular, if the loss of a small-bodied top predator (1) leads to a 'mesopredator release', affects primary consumers and changes whole community structures, and (2) triggers a cascade effect modifying the ecosystem function. To address these questions, we studied the top-down effects of a small endangered fish species, Barbus meridionalis (the Mediterranean barbel), conducting an enclosure/exclosure mesocosm experiment in an intermittent stream where B. meridionalis became locally extinct following a wildfire. We found that top predator absence led to 'mesopredator release', and also to 'prey release' despite intraguild predation, which contrasts with traditional food web theory. In addition, B. meridionalis extirpation changed whole macroinvertebrate community composition and increased total macroinvertebrate density. Regarding ecosystem function, periphyton primary production decreased in apex consumer absence. In this study, the apex consumer was functionally irreplaceable; its local extinction led to the loss of an important functional role that resulted in major changes to the ecosystem's structure and function. This study evidences that intermittent streams can be affected by the consequences of apex consumers' extinctions, and that the loss of small-bodied top predators can lead to large ecosystem changes. We recommend the reintroduction of small-bodied apex consumers to systems where they have been extirpated, to restore ecosystem structure and function.},

Another type of behavior that has been observed in simple food web experiments (Murdoch in Ecol. Monogr. 39:335-354, 1969) is prey switching. Prey switching can occur when the predator prefers the most abundant prey. This has also been shown to be capable of having either a stabilizing effect or a destabilizing effect and even possibly lead to predator extinction (VanLeeuwen et al. in Ecology 88:1571-1581, 2007). Therefore, it is clear that incorporating prey switching into an intraguild predation model could lead to unexpected consequences. In this paper, we propose and explore such a model.},

abstract = {The strength of interspecific interactions is often proposed to affect food web stability, with weaker interactions increasing the persistence of species, and food webs as a whole. However, the mechanisms that modify interaction strengths, and their effects on food web persistence are not fully understood. Using food webs containing different combinations of predator, prey, and nonprey species, we investigated how predation risk of susceptible prey is affected by the presence of species not directly trophically linked to either predators or prey. We predicted that indirect alterations to the strength of trophic interactions translate to changes in persistence time of extinction-prone species. We assembled interaction webs of protist consumers and turbellarian predators with eight different combinations of prey, predators and nonprey species, and recorded abundances for over 130 prey generations. Persistence of predation-susceptible species was increased by the presence of nonprey. Furthermore, multiple nonprey species acted synergistically to increase prey persistence, such that persistence was greater than would be predicted from the dynamics of simpler food webs. We also found evidence suggesting increased food web complexity may weaken interspecific competition, increasing persistence of poorer competitors. Our results demonstrate that persistence times in complex food webs cannot be predicted from the dynamics of simplified systems, and that species not directly involved in consumptive interactions likely play key roles in maintaining persistence. Global species diversity is currently declining at an unprecedented rate and our findings reveal that concurrent loss of species that modify trophic interactions may have unpredictable consequences for food web stability.},

abstract = {Measurements of the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels are consistent with the hypothesis that it is trophic structure that controls the fraction of energy consumed at each trophic level, rather than energetics controlling trophic structure. Moreover, trophic structure is determined by competitive and predator-prey interactions. In freshwater pelagic communities, the collective efficiency of herbivorous plankton in consuming primary producers is up to 10 times as great as is the efficiency of forest herbivores in consuming their food. Conversely, forest predators are about three times as efficient in consuming herbivore production. as are zooplanktivorous fish. The presence of an additional level, piscivorous fish, in pelagic communities accounts for the difference. In the aquatic system, herbivorous zooplankton are freed from predation by the effect of piscivorous fish on their predators; in the terrestrial system, green plants are freed from herbivory by predation on the herbivores. We explain the contrast between freshwater pelagic systems and forests and prairies as follows: Pelagic ecosystems have more trophic levels as a result of selection for small rapidly growing primary producers, which cannot hold space in the fluid medium, in contrast to large space-occupying producers in the terrestrial environment. Consumers in pelagic systems are more frequently gape limited in the size range of food they can ingest than are grasping consumers in terrestrial systems. This difference makes for two largely distinct levels of predators in pelagic communities. The energy within the living, nondetrital components is more finely divided between trophic levels in pelagic systems than in terrestrial systems. Ecological efficiencies do not determine trophic structure; rather, they are its product.},

abstract = {Empirical studies have shown that, in real ecosystems, species-interaction strengths are generally skewed in their distribution towards weak interactions. Some theoretical work also suggests that weak interactions, especially in omnivorous links, are important for the local stability of a community at equilibrium. However, the majority of theoretical studies use uniform distributions of interaction strengths to generate artificial communities for study. We investigate the effects of the underlying interaction-strength distribution upon the return time, permanence and feasibility of simple Lotka-Volterra equilibrium communities. We show that a skew towards weak interactions promotes local and global stability only when omnivory is present. It is found that skewed interaction strengths are an emergent property of stable omnivorous communities, and that this skew towards weak interactions creates a dynamic constraint maintaining omnivory. Omnivory is more likely to occur when omnivorous interactions are skewed towards weak interactions. However, a skew towards weak interactions increases the return time to equilibrium, delays the recovery of ecosystems and hence decreases the stability of a community. When no skew is imposed, the set of stable omnivorous communities shows an emergent distribution of skewed interaction strengths. Our results apply to both local and global concepts of stability and are robust to the definition of a feasible community. These results are discussed in the light of empirical data and other theoretical studies, in conjunction with their broader implications for community assembly.},

Because interaction frequency is easier to estimate than per-interaction effect, using interaction frequency as a surrogate of total effect could facilitate the large-scale analysis of quantitative patterns of species-rich interaction networks. We show mathematically that the correlation between interaction frequency (I) and total effect (T) becomes more strongly positive the greater the variation of I relative to the variation of per-interaction effect (P) and the greater the correlation between I and P. A meta-analysis using data on I, P and T for animal pollinators and seed dispersers visiting plants shows a generally strong, positive relationship between T and I, in spite of no general relationship between P and I. Thus, frequent animal mutualists usually contribute the most to plant reproduction, regardless of their effectiveness on a per-interaction basis.},

abstract = {Many important issues in community ecology revolve around the interplay of competition and predation. Species that compete may also be locked in predator-prey interactions, a mixture of competition and predation known as ''intraguild predation'' (IGP). There is growing evidence for the importance of IGP in many natural communities, yet little formal ecological theory addresses this particular blend of interactions. In this article, we explore the consequences of incorporating IGP into standard models of exploitative competition and food chains (a general resource-consumer model, a Lotka-Volterra food chain model, and Schoener's exploitative competition model). Our theoretical analyses suggest a general criterion for coexistence in IGP systems: the intermediate species (the prey in intraguild predation) should be superior at exploitative competition for the shared resource, whereas the top species (the predator) should gain significantly from its consumption of the intermediate species. Along gradients in environmental productivity, coexistence is most likely at intermediate levels of productivity. Analyses of the models reveal the potential for alternative stable states in systems with IGP; these are particularly likely if the top predator gains little benefit from consuming the intermediate predator. We further show that IGP can lead to unstable population dynamics, even when all pairwise interactions are inherently stable and each species can increase when rare. Persistent, strong IGP raises a puzzle of species coexistence, particularly in productive environments. We conclude by comparing IGP with related community modules (i.e., food chains, exploitative competition, apparent competition) and discussing mechanisms that should foster coexistence in systems with strong IGP.},

Recently, tools from random matrix theory have identified the main drivers of stability in ecological communities whose network structure is random. However, empirical food webs differ greatly from random graphs. For example, their degree distribution is broader, they contain few trophic cycles, and they are almost interval. Here we derive an approximation for the stability of food webs whose structure is generated by the cascade model, in which 'larger' species consume 'smaller' ones. We predict the stability of these food webs with great accuracy, and our approximation also works well for food webs whose structure is determined empirically or by the niche model. We find that intervality and broad degree distributions tend to stabilize food webs, and that average interaction strength has little influence on stability, compared with the effect of variance and correlation.},

abstract = {The loss of species from ecological communities can unleash a cascade of secondary extinctions, the risk and extent of which are likely to depend on the traits of the species that are lost from the community. To identify species traits that have the greatest impact on food web robustness to species loss we here subject allometrically scaled, dynamical food web models to several deletion sequences based on species' connectivity, generality, vulnerability or body mass. Further, to evaluate the relative importance of dynamical to topological effects we compare robustness between dynamical and purely topological models. This comparison reveals that the topological approach overestimates robustness in general and for certain sequences in particular. Top-down directed sequences have no or very low impact on robustness in topological analyses, while the dynamical analysis reveals that they may be as important as high-impact bottom-up directed sequences. Moreover, there are no deletion sequences that result, on average, in no or very few secondary extinctions in the dynamical approach. Instead, the least detrimental sequence in the dynamical approach yields an average robustness similar to the most detrimental (non-basal) deletion sequence in the topological approach. Hence, a topological analysis may lead to erroneous conclusions concerning both the relative and the absolute importance of different species traits for robustness. The dynamical sequential deletion analysis shows that food webs are least robust to the loss of species that have many trophic links or that occupy low trophic levels. In contrast to previous studies we can infer, albeit indirectly, that secondary extinctions were triggered by both bottom-up and top-down cascades. {\textcopyright} 2011 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.},

abstract = {Aggregations of biological species on the basis of trophic similarity (trophospecies) are the basic units of study in food web and ecosystem research, yet little attention has been devoted to articulating objective protocols for defining such aggregations. This study formulates several possible definitions based on alternative measures of similarity and hierarchical clustering. Twenty-four alternative methods were applied to a food web consisting of 116 original trophic entities (OTEs) from a tropical floodplain, for which the relative magnitude of each trophic link was estimated based on dietary data measured as volumetric proportions. The resulting 24 trophic hierarchies were compared based on cophenetic correlation and matrices of OTE pairwise similarity, and patterns were interpreted based on additional ecological analyses for this system. Similarity measures based on topological food web (presence/absence) data yielded slightly greater cophenetic correlations than did measures based on dietary proportions (flow webs), but, overall, OTE pairwise correlations were not greater for one method relative to the other. The difference between these two approaches is driven by the treatment of weak feeding links; at least for the system considered here, distinctions among dietary generalists were obscured when weak links were weighted lightly. Additively combining the predator and resource aspects of each OTE's trophic role performed better than combining them multiplicatively. In general, there was little correspondence between OTE overlap in resource use and the extent to which predators were shared. Two measures of cluster similarity. one designed by us specifically for food webs (maximum linkage) and the other a standard method (average similarity between clusters), yielded more consistent and ecologically interpretable patterns of aggregation than other measures of cluster similarity considered. In deciding whether two trophospecies should be assigned a trophic link, the maximum linkage convention (in which a link is included if any pair of OTEs, one in each trophospecies. are linked) produced more aggregation than the minimum linkage convention (in which a link is included only if every pair of OTEs, pair members in each of the two trophospecies, is linked). The choice of similarity level for defining trophospecies remained an unresolved issue based on our analysis of this dataset. Perhaps the greatest challenge is posed by sampling bias within empirical datasets, and we ultimately conclude that it is difficult to identify trophospecies in this dataset by strictly objective criteria.},

abstract = {Comparative research on food web structure has revealed generalities in trophic organization, produced simple models, and allowed assessment of robustness to species loss. These studies have mostly focused on free-living species. Recent research has suggested that inclusion of parasites alters structure. We assess whether such changes in network structure result from unique roles and traits of parasites or from changes to diversity and complexity. We analyzed seven highly resolved food webs that include metazoan parasite data. Our analyses show that adding parasites usually increases link density and connectance (simple measures of complexity), particularly when including concomitant links (links from predators to parasites of their prey). However, we clarify prior claims that parasites "dominate" food web links. Although parasites can be involved in a majority of links, in most cases classic predation links outnumber classic parasitism links. Regarding network structure, observed changes in degree distributions, 14 commonly studied metrics, and link probabilities are consistent with scale-dependent changes in structure associated with changes in diversity and complexity. Parasite and free-living species thus have similar effects on these aspects of structure. However, two changes point to unique roles of parasites. First, adding parasites and concomitant links strongly alters the frequency of most motifs of interactions among three taxa, reflecting parasites' roles as resources for predators of their hosts, driven by trophic intimacy with their hosts. Second, compared to free-living consumers, many parasites' feeding niches appear broader and less contiguous, which may reflect complex life cycles and small body sizes. This study provides new insights about generic versus unique impacts of parasites on food web structure, extends the generality of food web theory, gives a more rigorous framework for assessing the impact of any species on trophic organization, identifies limitations of current food web models, and provides direction for future structural and dynamical models.},

abstract = {The metabolic theory of ecology uses the scaling of metabolism with body size and temperature to explain the causes and consequences of species abundance. However, the theory and its empirical tests have never simultaneously examined parasites alongside free-living species. This is unfortunate because parasites represent at least half of species diversity. We show that metabolic scaling theory could not account for the abundance of parasitic or free-living species in three estuarine food webs until accounting for trophic dynamics. Analyses then revealed that the abundance of all species uniformly scaled with body mass to the -{\&}frac34; power. This result indicates "production equivalence," where biomass production within trophic levels is invariant of body size across all species and functional groups: invertebrate or vertebrate, ectothermic or endothermic, and free-living or parasitic.},

(2) A model is developed to describe this functional response, based on the concept of predator satiation. The number of prey items required to create satiation is shown to be dependent on the experimental procedures used to elicit the functional response. (3) The fish predator, Brachydanio rerio, acts in the dual role of predator/host for the cercarial stage of Transversotrema patialense. The concomitant predation and infection processes created by this ecological association are shown to be characterised by constant instantaneous predation and infection rates which appear to be unaffected by changes in prey/parasite density. (4) The infection process is unaffected by density dependent constraints over a wide range of exposure densities and the number of parasites attached per host is shown to be directly proportional to cercarial numbers. (5) Stochastic elements are shown to be important determinants in the dynamics of the infection process and overdispersion in the frequency distribution of the number of parasites attached per host is thought to be generated by heterogeneity between fish and heterogeneity in time created by changes in infective stage density. (6) The relevance of concomitant predation and infection processes to the dynamics of digenean life cycles is discussed.},

This functional response largely determines dynamic stability, responses to environmental influences and the nature of indirect effects in the food web containing the predator- prey pair. Nevertheless, measurements of functional responses in nature are quite rare. Recently, much work has been devoted to comparing two idealized forms of the functional response: prey dependent and ratio dependent. Although we agree that predator abundance often affects the consumption rate of individual predators, this phenomenon requires more attention. Disagreement remains over which of the two idealized responses serves as a better starting point in building models when data on predator dependence are absent.},

The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and related theories based on these fundamental population processes have successfully recreated general species-abundance patterns without accounting for either the variation among species and individuals or resource-releasing processes such as predation and disturbance, long emphasized in ecological theory. If ecological communities can be described adequately without estimating variation in species and their interactions, our understanding of ecological community organization and the predicted consequences of reduced biodiversity and environmental change would shift markedly. Here, I introduce a strong method to test the neutral theory that combines field parameterization of the underlying population dynamics with a field experiment, and apply it to a rocky intertidal community. Although the observed abundance-frequency distribution of the system follows that predicted by the neutral theory, the neutral theory predicts poorly the field experimental results, indicating an essential role for variation in species interactions.},

Some trematodes show even more extreme forms of life cycle abbreviations, using only a mollusc to complete their cycle, with or without sexual reproduction. The occurrence of these phenomena among trematode families are reviewed here and show that life cycle truncation has evolved independently many times in the phylogeny of trematodes. The hypotheses proposed to account for life-cycle truncation, in addition to the factors preventing the adoption of shorter cycles by all trematodes are also discussed. The study of shorter life cycles offers an opportunity to understand the forces shaping the evolution of life cycles in general.},

In this study, an index of host specificity recently proposed was used to test, quantitatively, the hypothesis that some groups of parasites are characteristics of some host fish families along their distribution range. A database with all published records on the helminth parasites of freshwater siluriforms of Mexico was used. The host specificity index was used considering its advantage to measure the taxonomic heterogeneity of the host assemblages and its appropriateness for unequal sampling data. The helminth parasite fauna of freshwater siluriforms in Mexico seems to be specific for different host taxonomic categories. However, a relatively high number of species (47{\%} of the total helminth fauna) is specific to their respective host family. This result provides further corroboration for the biogeographic hypothesis of the core helminth fauna proposed previously. The statistical values for host specificity obtained herein seem to be independent of host range. However, the accurate taxonomic identification of the parasites is fundamental for the evaluation of host specificity and the accurate evolutionary interpretation of this phenomenon.},

abstract = {Using species-level phylogenies, the speciation mode of Gyrodactylus species infecting a single host genus was evaluated. Eighteen Gyrodactylus species were collected from gobies of the genus Pomatoschistus and sympatric fish species across the distribution range of the hosts. The V4 region of the ssrRNA and the internal transcribed spacers encompassing the 5.8S rRNA gene were sequenced; by including published sequences a total of 30 species representing all subgenera were used in the data analyses. The molecular phylogeny did not support the morphological groupings into subgenera as based on the excretory system, suggesting that the genus needs systematic revisions. Paraphyly of the total Gyrodactylus fauna of the gobies indicates that at least two independent colonisation events were involved, giving rise to two separate groups, belonging to the subgenus Mesonephrotus and Paranephrotus, respectively. The most recent association probably originated from a host switching event from Gyrodactylus arcuatus, which parasitises three-spined stickleback, onto Pomatoschistus gobies. These species are highly host-specific and form a monophyletic group, two possible 'signatures' of co-speciation. Host specificity was lower in the second group. The colonising capacity of these species is illustrated by a host jump from gobiids to another fish order (Anguilliformes), supporting the hypothesis of a European origin of Gyrodactylus anguillae and its intercontinental introduction by the eel trade. Thus, allopatric speciation seems to be the dominant mode of speciation in this host-parasite system, with a possible case of sympatric speciation. ?? 2003 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

Results depend on the abundance and growth rate of the algae, the filtration rate and density of the zooplankton, the strategy-dependent efficiency of converting food into reproduction, temperature-dependent egg developmental time, day length, and predation pressure. In addition to regions where the 2 strategies exclude each other, it is also possible for a population to reach an evolutionarily stable equilibrium mixture of strategies. At high food concentrations, equilibrium is unlikely because it would require a predation risk increasing with prey abundance; but at low food concentrations, strategy mixtures can be stable for many combinations of realistic model parameters, even with density-independent mortality caused by fish predation. Temporal variation in the selective forces shifts this equilibrium point. Therefore, the model can explain seasonal changes and long-term trends in the pattern of diel vertical migration. -from Authors},

Proposed metabolic advantages of vertical migration have received much attention, but relatively little experimental support. Nocturnal migrations may also represent an adap- tive behavior for avoidance of damaging solar radiation. One is struck with the variations in diel behavior patterns and the apparent plasticity of zooplankton in adapting diel behaviors to fit specific environments. Recent studies considering multiple causes of vertical migration show much promise, Problems and improvements in studies of diel zooplankton behavior are discussed.},

They usually ascend from deeper waters to surficial strata at dusk and descend at dawn. Zooplankton feeders such as fish and macrocrustacea, also migrate, following their prey. This migration is caused by the behavioral response of the zooplankton to the variation in light intensity (Siebeck 1960; Daan and Ringelberg 1969). On the other hand, the adaptive significance of this movement has been explained by many factors: e.g., the harmfulness of direct solar radiation (Huntsman 1924; Hairston 1976), the effect of shading on the reduction of the photosynthesis by phytoplankton (McAl- lister 1969; Kerfoot 1970), increased genetic exchange (David 1961), optimal phytoplankton harvesting (Conover 1968; Enright 1977) and demographic advan- tages of cold subsurface temperature (McLaren 1974; Enright and Honegger 1977). Here I focus on the hypothesis that a zooplankton migrates to avoid predators that hunt by sight (Murray and Hjort 1912). I propose a habitat-selection game between predator and prey.

In this study, we sampled periphyton from three New Zealand lakes: Tikitapu (oligotrophic), Ōkāreka (mesotrophic) and Rotoiti (eutrophic). Statistical analysis of morphological data showed a clear delineation in community structure among lakes and highlighted the importance of cyanobacteria. Automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were used to investigate cyanobacterial diversity. Despite the close geographic proximity of the lakes, cyanobacterial species differed markedly. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis identified eight cyanobacterial OTUs. A comparison with other known cyanobacterial sequences in GenBank showed relatively low similarities (91-97{\%}). Cyanotoxin analysis identified nodularin in all mats from Lake Tikitapu. ndaF gene sequences from these samples had very low (≤ 89{\%}) homology to sequences in other known nodularin producers. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of nodularin in a freshwater environment in the absence of Nodularia. Six cyanobacteria species were isolated from Lake Tikitapu mats. None were found to produce nodularin. Five of the species shared low ({\textless} 97{\%}) 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with other cultured cyanobacteria.},

Stomach contents and infection levels of three gastrointestinal helminth species were examined from the entire fish community. The results highlighted some links between fish host diet and the flow of trophically transmitted helminths. Stomach contents indicated that all but one fish species were exposed to these helminths through their diet. Host feeding behaviour best explained infection patterns of the trematode Coitocaecum parvum among the fish community. Infection levels of the nematode Hedruris spinigera and the acanthocephalan Acanthocephalus galaxii, however, were not correlated with host diets. Host specificity is thus likely to modulate parasite infection patterns. The data indicate that host diet and host-parasite compatibility both contribute to the distribution of helminths in the fish community. Furthermore, the relative influence of encounter (trophic interactions between prey and predator hosts) and compatibility (host suitability) filters on infection levels appeared to vary between host-parasite species associations. Therefore, understanding parasite infection patterns and their potential impacts on fish communities requires determining the relative roles of encounter and compatibility filters within and across all potential host-parasite associations.},

The catch from 2 shallow lower Waikato lakes of this and 5 other gear types frequently used in freshwater fisheries research in New Zealand are compared. The trap net caught the widest range of fish species and sizes, and was the least selective for species composi tion and relative abundance of any individual gear type. A combination of trap net and gill net caught the widest range of species and sizes for individual or pairwise combinations of gear types, and is recommended as being the best combination for sampling shallow-lake fish communities in New Zealand.},

abstract = {The number of sites sampled must be considered when determining the effort necessary for adequately assessing taxa richness in an ecosystem for bioassessment purposes; however, there have been few studies concerning the number of sites necessary for bioassessment of large rivers. We evaluated the effect of sample size (i.e., number of sites) necessary to collect vertebrate (fish and aquatic amphibians), macroinvertebrate, and diatom taxa from seven large rivers in Oregon and Washington, USA during the summers of 2006-2008. We used Monte Carlo simulation to determine the number of sites needed to collect 90-95{\%} of the taxa 75-95{\%} of the time from 20 randomly located sites on each river. The river wetted widths varied from 27.8 to 126.0 m, mean substrate size varied from 1 to 10 cm, and mainstem distances sampled varied from 87 to 254 km. We sampled vertebrates at each site (i.e., 50 times the mean wetted channel width) by nearshore-raft electrofishing. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates nearshore through the use of a 500-$\mu$m mesh kick net at 11 systematic stations. From each site composite sample, we identified a target of 500 macroinvertebrate individuals to the lowest possible taxon, usually genus. We sampled benthic diatoms nearshore at the same 11 stations from a 12-cm(2) area. At each station, we sucked diatoms from soft substrate into a 60-ml syringe or brushed them off a rock and rinsed them with river water into the same jar. We counted a minimum of 600 valves at 1,000× magnification for each site. We collected 120-211 diatom taxa, 98-128 macroinvertebrate taxa, and 14-33 vertebrate species per river. To collect 90-95{\%} of the taxa 75-95{\%} of the time that were collected at 20 sites, it was necessary to sample 11-16 randomly distributed sites for vertebrates, 13-17 sites for macroinvertebrates, and 16-18 sites for diatoms. We conclude that 12-16 randomly distributed sites are needed for cost-efficient sampling of vertebrate richness in the main stems of our study rivers, but 20 sites markedly underestimates the species richness of benthic macroinvertebrates and diatoms in those rivers.},

abstract = {Calculates the differences in payoffs between diel vertical migrating and nonmigrating zooplankton. Results depend on the abundance and growth rate of the algae, the filtration rate and density of the zooplankton, the strategy-dependent efficiency of converting food into reproduction, temperature-dependent egg developmental time, day length, and predation pressure. In addition to regions where the 2 strategies exclude each other, it is also possible for a population to reach an evolutionarily stable equilibrium mixture of strategies. At high food concentrations, equilibrium is unlikely because it would require a predation risk increasing with prey abundance; but at low food concentrations, strategy mixtures can be stable for many combinations of realistic model parameters, even with density-independent mortality caused by fish predation. Temporal variation in the selective forces shifts this equilibrium point. Therefore, the model can explain seasonal changes and long-term trends in the pattern of diel vertical migration. -from Authors},

abstract = {Although multihost complex life cycles (CLCs) are common in several distantly related groups of parasites, their evolution remains poorly understood. In this article, we argue that under particular circumstances, adding a second host to a single-host life cycle is likely to enhance transmission (i.e., reaching the target host). For instance, in several situations, the propagules of a parasite exploiting a predator species will achieve a higher host-finding success by encysting in a prey of the target predator than by other dispersal modes. In such a case, selection should favor the transition from a single- to a two-host life cycle that includes the prey species as an intermediate host. We use an optimality model to explore this idea, and we discuss it in relation to dispersal strategies known among free-living species, especially animal dispersal. The model found that selection favored a complex life cycle only if intermediate hosts were more abundant than definitive hosts. The selective value of a complex life cycle increased with predation rates by definitive hosts on intermediate hosts. In exploring trade-offs between transmission strategies, we found that more costly trade-offs made it more difficult to evolve a CLC while less costly trade-offs between traits could favor a mixed strategy.},

abstract = {Parasites that are transmitted through predator-prey interactions may be used as indicators of trophic relationships between organisms. Yet, they are rarely used as such in the construction of topological (predator-prey) food webs. We constructed food webs of vertebrate trophic interactions using observed diet alone, trophically transmitted parasites alone, and the combination of the two based on data from 31 species of fish from the Bothnian Bay, Finland. The fish food web contained 530 links derived from observed diet, 724 links inferred from parasitism, and 1,058 links calculated from a combination of both stomach contents and parasites. This sub-web constructed from stomach contents had a mean of 17.1 links per fish species, while that using parasites had 23.4 links per fish. Combining the two diet indicators yielded 34.1 links per fish species, illustrating the complementarity of the two methods. Mean number of prey species per fish species was 12.5 using observed diet items, 15.8 using parasites, and 24.5 using both measures together. Mean number of predators per fish species was 7.4 using observed diet, 11.7 using parasites and 15.0 using both. A positive correlation was found between the mean number of parasites and the number of prey taxa in the diet among the fishes. Omnivorous fish had the highest diversity of both parasite species and prey items, while benthophagous fish had among the lowest. Mean total abundance and mean total prevalence of parasites correlated positively with fish size, with piscivores being the largest with the highest abundance and prevalence, while planktivores and benthivores had the lowest. Trophically transmitted parasites may be used to help construct vertebrate sub-webs and derive information about food web processes. Parasites alone provided equivalent if not more information than observed diet. However, resolution is improved by using parasites and observed diet together.},

This study tests the prediction that trophically transmitted parasites are funneled towards asymmetric predator-prey interactions where intermediate hosts have few predators and definitive hosts feed upon many prey ('downward asymmetry'). The distribution of trophically transmitted parasites was examined in four published food webs in relation to mismatch asymmetry of predator-prey interactions. We found that trophically transmitted parasites exploit downwardly asymmetric interactions in a nonrandom manner, and particular predator-prey pairs contain more trophically transmitted parasites than would be expected by random chance alone. These findings suggest that food web topology has great bearing on the ecology of trophically transmitted parasites, and that consideration of parasite life cycles in the context of food web organization can provide insights into the forces affecting the evolution of trophic transmission.},

Using recently published data and the tool of network analysis, we elucidate features associated with the pattern of parasitism in ecological communities. First we show here that parasitism is non-random in food webs. Second we demonstrate that parasite diversity, the number of parasite species harboured by a host species, is related to the network position of a host species. Specifically, a host species with high parasite diversity tends to have a wide diet range, occupy a network position close to many prey species, or occupy a network position that can better accumulate resources from species at lower trophic levels. Lastly our results also suggest that a host species with higher vulnerability to predators, being at a network position close to many predatory species, or being involved in many different food chains, tends to be important in parasite transmission},

We investigated the impact of species abundance distributions on qualitative and quantitative metrics of 113 host-parasite networks. We analyzed the concordance between neutral expectations and empirical observations at interaction, species, and network levels. We found that species abundance accurately predicts network metrics at all levels. Despite host-parasite systems being constrained by physiology and immunology, our results suggest that neutrality could also explain, at least partially, their structure. We hypothesize that trait matching would determine potential interactions between species, while abundance would determine their realization.},

abstract = {The threespine stickleback fish, Gasterosteus aculeatus, is parasitized by the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus in freshwater habitats. The competency of the parasite to infect a definitive host, one of many piscivorous birds, is associated with behavioral changes in parasitized stickleback that are likely to increase the chance of transmission to a definitive host. Over a limited geographical range, large tapeworm size is also associated with demelanization, a phenotypic change in the stickleback host that involves a dramatic loss of melanin in the skin and, simultaneously, a darkening of the eye. We demonstrate that stickleback harboring a worm large enough to be infective to a definitive host exhibit behavioral shifts likely to enhance transmission, but that these changes are substantially magnified in demelanized individuals, all of which were infected by large tapeworms. The results were similar whether we used a model of a bird flown over an aquarium, or a preserved trout moved to simulate attack under field conditions. Because changes in the levels of response to both kinds of predators were similar, we infer that behavioral modifications that enhance susceptibility to visually hunting predators that are definitive hosts also enhance susceptibility to visually hunting predators (e.g. trout) that are not. In lakes where predatory fishes are common, the impact on S. solidus transmission could be substantial. Although other studies have suggested that positive buoyancy, forcing infected fish to remain near the surface, is one cause of these behavioral shifts, we detected no differences in water column position among unparasitized and parasitized classes of stickleback. Instead, infected stickleback appeared to move sluggishly and were less likely to respond to simulated attacks than were uninfected fish, and the behavioral shift was most dramatic in demelanized stickleback.

abstract = {Parasites with complex life cycles, relying on trophic transmission to a definitive host, very often induce changes in the behaviour or appearance of their intermediate hosts. Because this usually makes the intermediate host vulnerable to predation by the definitive host, it is generally assumed that the parasite's transmission rate is increased, and that the modification of the host is, therefore, of great adaptive significance to the parasite. However, in the ecological "real world" other predators unsuitable as hosts may just as well take advantage of the facilitation process and significantly erode the benefit of host manipulation. Here we show that the intertidal New Zealand cockle (Austrovenus stutchburyi), manipulated by its echinostome trematode (Curtuteria australis) to rest on the sediment surface fully exposed to predation from the avian definitive host, is also subject to sublethal predation from a benthic feeding fish (Notolabrus celidotus, Labridae). The fish is targeting only the cockle-foot, in which the parasite preferentially encysts, reducing the infection intensity of manipulated cockles to levels comparable with those in non-manipulated, buried cockles. Based on the frequency and intensity of the foot cropping and predation rates on surfaced cockles by avian hosts, it is estimated that 2.5{\%} of the parasite population in manipulated cockles is transmitted successfully whereas 17.1{\%} is lost to fish. We argue that the adaptive significance of manipulation in the present system depends critically on the feeding behaviour of the definitive host. If cockles constitute the majority of prey items, there will be selection against manipulation. If manipulated cockles are taken as an easily accessible supplement to a diet composed mostly of other prey organisms, behavioural manipulation of the cockle host appears a high risk, high profit transmission strategy. Both these feeding behaviours of birds are known to occur in the field. ?? 2003 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {By modifying the behaviour and morphology of hosts, parasites may strongly impact host individuals, populations and communities. We examined the effects of a common trematode parasite on its snail host, Batillaria cumingi (Batillariidae). This widespread snail is usually the most abundant invertebrate in salt marshes and mudflats of the northeastern coast of Asia. More than half (52.6{\%}, n=1360) of the snails in our study were infected. We found that snails living in the lower intertidal zone were markedly larger and exhibited different shell morphology than those in the upper intertidal zone. The large morphotypes in the lower tidal zone were all infected by the trematode, Cercaria batillariae (Heterophyidae). We used a transplant experiment, a mark-and-recapture experiment and stable carbon isotope ratios to reveal that snails infected by the trematode move to the lower intertidal zone, resume growth after maturation and consume different resources. By simultaneously changing the morphology and behaviour of individual hosts, this parasite alters the demographics and potentially modifies resource use of the snail population. Since trematodes are common and often abundant in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the world, their effects potentially alter food webs in many systems.},

abstract = {Variations in levels of parasitism among individuals in a population of hosts underpin the importance of parasites as an evolutionary or ecological force. Factors influencing parasite richness (number of parasite species) and load (abundance and biomass) at the individual host level ultimately form the basis of parasite infection patterns. In fish, diet range (number of prey taxa consumed) and prey selectivity (proportion of a particular prey taxon in the diet) have been shown to influence parasite infection levels. However, fish diet is most often characterized at the species or fish population level, thus ignoring variation among conspecific individuals and its potential effects on infection patterns among individuals. Here, we examined parasite infections and stomach contents of New Zealand freshwater fish at the individual level. We tested for potential links between the richness, abundance and biomass of helminth parasites and the diet range and prey selectivity of individual fish hosts. There was no obvious link between individual fish host diet and helminth infection levels. Our results were consistent across multiple fish host and parasite species and contrast with those of earlier studies in which fish diet and parasite infection were linked, hinting at a true disconnect between host diet and measures of parasite infections in our study systems. This absence of relationship between host diet and infection levels may be due to the relatively low richness of freshwater helminth parasites in New Zealand and high host–parasite specificity.},

Modularity hampers extinction cascades, whereas nestedness resists network disassembly. We explore these parameters in seed-dispersal networks in two archipelagos and the significance of life history, habitat, geography and phylogeny as drivers of linkage patterns and the applicability of modules as biogeographical entities.   Location  Canaries (Atlantic Ocean) and Gal{\'{a}}pagos (Pacific Ocean).   Methods  We compiled data on plant–seed disperser interactions from own observations and the literature, estimated network parameters describing interaction patterns (connectance, nestedness and modularity) and constructed a backbone phylogeny for the analyses.   Results  The Canarian network was highly nested but weakly modular, whereas the Gal{\'{a}}pagos network showed the opposite characteristics. Most key network species are native and have a favourable conservation status. Modularity in the Canaries is correlated with habitats (indirectly affected by altitude and orientation), whereas in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos it mainly reflects the functional roles of species.   Main conclusions  The divergent link patterns for the archipelagos imply that the highly nested Canarian network is stable against disassembly, whereas the modular Gal{\'{a}}pagos network may show strong resistance against extinction cascades. This difference may be driven by the specific evolutionary dynamics on the archipelagos. },

abstract = {Understanding the consequences of species loss in complex ecological communities is one of the great challenges in current biodiversity research. For a long time, this topic has been addressed by traditional biodiversity experiments. Most of these approaches treat species as trait-free, taxonomic units characterizing communities only by species number without accounting for species traits. However, extinctions do not occur at random as there is a clear correlation between extinction risk and species traits. In this review, we assume that large species will be most threatened by extinction and use novel allometric and size-spectrum concepts that include body mass as a primary species trait at the levels of populations and individuals, respectively, to re-assess three classic debates on the relationships between biodiversity and (i) food-web structural complexity, (ii) community dynamic stability, and (iii) ecosystem functioning. Contrasting current expectations, size-structured approaches suggest that the loss of large species, that typically exploit most resource species, may lead to future food webs that are less interwoven and more structured by chains of interactions and compartments. The disruption of natural body-mass distributions maintaining food-web stability may trigger avalanches of secondary extinctions and strong trophic cascades with expected knock-on effects on the functionality of the ecosystems. Therefore, we argue that it is crucial to take into account body size as a species trait when analysing the consequences of biodiversity loss for natural ecosystems. Applying size-structured approaches provides an integrative ecological concept that enables a better understanding of each species' unique role across communities and the causes and consequences of biodiversity loss.},

abstract = {1. In natural communities, populations are linked by feeding interactions that make up complex food webs. The stability of these complex networks is critically dependent on the distribution of energy fluxes across these feeding links. 2. In laboratory experiments with predatory beetles and spiders, we studied the allometric scaling (body-mass dependence) of metabolism and per capita consumption at the level of predator individuals and per link energy fluxes at the level of feeding links. 3. Despite clear power-law scaling of the metabolic and per capita consumption rates with predator body mass, the per link predation rates on individual prey followed hump-shaped relationships with the predator-prey body mass ratios. These results contrast with the current metabolic paradigm, and find better support in foraging theory. 4. This suggests that per link energy fluxes from prey populations to predator individuals peak at intermediate body mass ratios, and total energy fluxes from prey to predator populations decrease monotonically with predator and prey mass. Surprisingly, contrary to predictions of metabolic models, this suggests that for any prey species, the per link and total energy fluxes to its largest predators are smaller than those to predators of intermediate body size. 5. An integration of metabolic and foraging theory may enable a quantitative and predictive understanding of energy flux distributions in natural food webs.},

However, it is not known how the evolutionary isolation of a plant affects the fitness of an insect herbivore living on such a plant, especially the herbivore's enemy pressure. Here, we suggest that evolutionary isolation of host plants may operate similarly as spatial isolation and reduce the enemy pressure per insect herbivore. We investigated the effect of the phylogenetic isolation of host trees on the pressure exerted by specialist and generalist enemies (parasitoids and birds) on ectophagous Lepidoptera and galling Hymenoptera. We found that the phylogenetic isolation of host trees decreases pressure by specialist enemies on these insect herbivores. In Lepidoptera, decreasing enemy pressure resulted from the density dependence of enemy attack, a mechanism often observed in herbivores. In contrast, in galling Hymenoptera, enemy pressure declined with the phylogenetic isolation of host trees per se, as well as with the parallel decline in leaf damage by non-galling insects. Our results suggest that plants that leave their phylogenetic ancestral neighborhood can trigger, partly through simple density-dependency, an enemy release and fitness increase of the few insect herbivores that succeed in tracking these plants.},

However, even spatially neighbouring hosts may be separated by many million years of evolutionary history, potentially reducing the establishment of natural enemies and their impact. We tested whether phylogenetic isolation of oak hosts from neighbouring trees within a forest canopy reduces phytophagy. We found that an increase in phylogenetic isolation by 100 million years corresponded to a 10-fold decline in phytophagy. This was not due to poorer living conditions for phytophages on phylogenetically isolated oaks. Neither species diversity of neighbouring trees nor spatial distance to the closest oak affected phytophagy. We suggest that reduced pressure by natural enemies is a major advantage for individuals within a host species that leave their ancestral niche and grow among distantly related species.},

We use these methods to ask whether closely related consumer species are more likely to attack the same resource species and whether closely related resource species are more likely to be attacked by the same consumer species. We then show how to use estimates of phylogenetic signals to predict novel consumer-resource associations solely from the phylogenetic position of species for which no other (or only partial) data are available. Finally, we show how to combine phylogenetic information with information about species' ecological characteristics and life-history traits to estimate the effects of species traits on consumer-resource associations while accounting for phylogenies. We illustrate these techniques using a food web comprising species of parasitoids, leaf-mining moths, and their host plants.},

abstract = {1. Pest regulation is an important ecosystem service provided by biodiversity, as plants grow- ing in species-rich communities often experience associational resistance to herbivores. How- ever, little is known about the respective influence of the quantity and identity of associated species on herbivory in focal plants. 2. Using a meta-analysis to compare insect herbivory in pure and mixed forests, we specifi- cally tested the effects of the relative abundance of focal tree species and of phylogenetic dis- tance between focal and associated tree species on the magnitude of associational resistance. 3. Overall, insect herbivory was significantly lower in mixed forests, but the outcome varied greatly depending on the phylogenetic relatedness among tree species and the degree of herbi- vore feeding specialization. 4. Specialist herbivore damage or abundance was positively related to relative abundance of their host trees, regardless of the phylogenetic distance between host and associated tree species. 5. By contrast, tree diversity triggered associational resistance to generalist herbivores only when tree mixtures included tree species phylogenetically distant to the focal species. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that the establishment of mixed forests per se is not sufficient to convey associational resistance to herbivores if the identity of tree species associated in mixtures is not taken into account. As a general rule, mixing phylogenet- ically more distinct tree species, such as mixtures of conifers and broadleaved trees, results in more effective reduction in herbivore damage.},

abstract = {When a system has more than one stable state, how can the stability of these states be compared? This deceptively simple question has important consequences for ecosystems, because systems with alternative stable states can undergo dramatic regime shifts. The probability, frequency, duration, and dynamics of these shifts will all depend on the relative stability of the stable states. Unfortunately, the concept of “stability” in ecology has suffered from substantial confusion and this is particularly problematic for systems where stochastic perturbations can cause shifts between coexisting alternative stable states. A useful way to visualize stable states in stochastic systems is with a ball-in-cup- diagram, in which the state of the system is represented as the position of a ball rolling on a surface, and the random perturbations can push the ball from one basin of attraction to another. The surface is determined by a potential function, which provides a natural stability metric. Systems amenable to this representation, called gradient systems, are quite rare, however. As a result, the potential function is not widely used and other approaches based on linear stability analysis have become standard. Linear stability analysis is designed for local analysis of deterministic systems and, as we show, can produce a highly misleading picture of how the system will behave under continual, stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we show how the potential function can be generalized so that it can be applied broadly, employing a concept from stochastic analysis called the quasi-potential. Using three classic ecological models, we demonstrate that the quasi-potential provides a useful way to quantify stability in stochastic systems. We show that the quasi-potential framework helps clarify long-standing confusion about stability in stochastic ecological systems, and we argue that ecologists should adopt it as a practical tool for analyzing these systems.},

abstract = {DNA sequences offer powerful tools for describing the members and interactions of natural communities. In this paper, we establish the to-date most comprehensive library of DNA barcodes for a terrestrial site, including all known macroscopic animals and vascular plants of an intensively-studied area of the High Arctic, the Zackenberg Valley in Northeast Greenland. To demonstrate its utility, we apply the library to identify nearly 20 000 arthropod individuals from two Malaise traps, each operated for two summers. Drawing on this material, we estimate the coverage of previous morphology-based species inventories, derive a snapshot of faunal turnover in space and time, and describe the abundance and phenology of species in the rapidly changing arctic environment. Overall, 403 terrestrial animal and 160 vascular plant species were recorded by morphology-based techniques. DNA barcodes (CO1) offered high resolution in discriminating among the local animal taxa, with 92{\%} of morphologically distinguishable taxa assigned to unique Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) and 93{\%} to monophyletic clusters. For vascular plants, resolution was lower, with 54{\%} of species forming monophyletic clusters based on barcode regions rbcLa and ITS2. Malaise catches revealed 122 BINs not detected by previous sampling and DNA barcoding. The insect community was dominated by a few highly abundant taxa. Even closely-related taxa differed in phenology, emphasizing the need for species-level resolution when describing ongoing shifts in arctic communities and ecosystems. The DNA barcode library now established for Zackenberg offers new scope for such explorations, and for the detailed dissection of interspecific interactions throughout the community.

abstract = {Advancing phenology in response to global warming has been reported across biomes1,2, raising concerns about the temporal uncoupling of trophic interactions3,4. Concurrently, widely reported flower visitor declines have been linked to resource limitations5. Phenological responses in the Arctic have been shown to outpace responses from lower latitudes and recent studies suggest that differences between such responses for plants and their flower visitors could be particularly pronounced in the Arctic1,6. The evidence for phenological uncoupling is scant because relevant data sets are lacking7 or not available at a relevant spatial scale8. Here, we present evidence of a climate-associated shortening of the flowering season and a concomitant decline in flower visitor abundance based on a long-term, spatially replicated (1996–2009) data set from high-Arctic Greenland. A unique feature of the data set is the spatial and temporal overlap of independent observations of plant and insect phenology. The shortening of the flowering season arose through spatial variation in phenological responses to warming. The shorter flowering seasons may have played a role in the observed decline in flower visitor abundance. Our results demonstrate that the dramatic climatic changes currently taking place in the Arctic are strongly affecting individual species and ecological communities, with implications for trophic interactions.

Their taxonomic diversity ranges from Nematocera to Brachycera, including most families within the suborders. Especially important are Syrphidae, Bombyliidae, and Muscoidea. Other families, especially of small flies, are less appreciated and often overlooked for their associations with flowers. We have compiled records of their flower visitations to show that they may be more prevalent than usually thought. Our knowledge of anthophilous Diptera needs to be enhanced by future research concerning (i) the sig- nificance of nocturnal Nematocera and acalypterate muscoids as pollinators, (ii) the extent to which the relatively ineffective pollen-canying ability of some taxa can be compensated by the abundance of individuals, and (iii) the role of Diptera as pollinators of the first flowering plants (Angiospermae) by using phylogenetic and palaeontological evidence. Specializations in floral relationships involve the mor- phology of Diptera, especially of their mouthparts, nutritional requirements, and be- haviour, as well as concomitant floral attributes. The South African flora has the most highly specialized relations with dipterous pollinators, but in arctic and alpine generalist fly-flower relations are important in pollination and fly nutrition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate change is particularly pronounced in the High Arctic and a better understanding of the repercussions on ecological processes like herbivory, predation and pollination is needed. Arthropods play an important role in the high-arctic ecosystem and this role is determined by their density and activity. However, density and activity may be sensitive to separate components of climate. Earlier emergence due to advanced timing of snowmelt following climate change may expose adult arthropods to unchanged temperatures but higher levels of radiation. The capture rate of arthropods in passive open traps like pitfall trap integrates density and activity and, therefore, serves as a proxy of the magnitude of such arthropod-related ecological processes. We used arthropod pitfall trapping data and weather data from 10 seasons in high-arctic Greenland to identify climatic effects on the activity pattern of nine arthropod taxa. RESULTS: We were able to statistically separate the variation in capture rates into a non-linear component of capture date (density) and a linear component of weather (activity). The non-linear proxy of density always accounted for more of the variation than the linear component of weather. After accounting for the seasonal phenological development, the most important weather variable influencing the capture rate of flying arthropods was temperature, while surface-dwelling species were principally influenced by solar radiation. CONCLUSION: Consistent with previous findings, air temperature best explained variation in the activity level of flying insects. An advancement of the phenology in this group due to earlier snowmelt will make individuals appear earlier in the season, but parallel temperature increases could mean that individuals are exposed to similar temperatures. Hence, the effect of climatic changes on the activity pattern in this group may be unchanged. In contrast, we found that solar radiation is a better proxy of activity levels than air temperature in surface-dwelling arthropods. An advancement of the phenology may expose surface-dwelling arthropods to higher levels of solar radiation, which suggest that their locomotory performance is enhanced and their contribution to ecological processes is increased.},

abstract = {1. Shifts in the spatial and temporal patterns of flowering could affect the resources available to pollinators, and such shifts might become more common as climate change progresses. 2. As mid-summer temperatures have warmed, we found that a montane meadow ecosystem in the southern Rocky Mountains of the United States exhibits a trend toward a bimodal distribution of flower abundance, characterized by a mid-season reduction in total flower number, instead of a broad, unimodal flowering peak lasting most of the summer season. 3. We examined the shapes of community-level flowering curves in this system and found that the typical unimodal peak results from a pattern of complementary peaks in flowering among three distinct meadow types (dry, mesic and wet) within the larger ecosystem. However, high mid-summer temperatures were associated with divergent shifts in the flowering curves of these individual meadow types. Specifically, warmer summers appeared to cause increasing bimodality in mesic habitats, and a longer interval between early and late flowering peaks in wet and dry habitats. 4. Together, these habitat-specific shifts produced a longer mid-season valley in floral abundance across the larger ecosystem in warmer years. Because of these warming-induced changes in flowering patterns, and the significant increase in summer temperatures in our study area, there has been a trend toward non-normality of flowering curves over the period 1974–2009. This trend reflects increasing bimodality in total community-wide flowering. 5. The resulting longer periods of low flowering abundance in the middle of the summer season could negatively affect pollinators that are active throughout the season, and shifts in flowering peaks within habitats might create mismatches between floral resources and demand by pollinators with limited foraging ranges. 6. Synthesis. Early-season climate conditions are getting warmer and drier in the high altitudes of the southern Rocky Mountains. We present evidence that this climate change is disrupting flowering phenology within and among different moisture habitats in a sub-alpine meadow ecosystem, causing a mid-season decline in floral resources that might negatively affect mutualists, especially pollinators. Our findings suggest that climate change can have complex effects on phenology at small spatial scales, depending on patch-level habitat differences.},

Less well appreciated is the likelihood that climate change will directly disrupt or eliminate mutually beneficial (mutualistic) ecological interactions between species even before extinctions occur. We explored the potential disruption of a ubiquitous mutualistic interaction of terrestrial habitats, that between plants and their animal pollinators, via climate change. We used a highly resolved empirical network of interactions between 1420 pollinator and 429 plant species to simulate consequences of the phenological shifts that can be expected with a doubling of atmospheric CO(2). Depending on model assumptions, phenological shifts reduced the floral resources available to 17-50{\%} of all pollinator species, causing as much as half of the ancestral activity period of the animals to fall at times when no food plants were available. Reduced overlap between plants and pollinators also decreased diet breadth of the pollinators. The predicted result of these disruptions is the extinction of pollinators, plants and their crucial interactions.},

Results from our two-year warming experiment combined with seven years of observations of plant phenology and offspring production by caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Greenland, however, contradict evidence from large-scale analyses. At spatial scales relevant to the foraging horizon of individual herbivores, spatial variability in plant phenology was reduced--not increased--by both experimental and observed warming. Concurrently, offspring production by female caribou declined with reductions in spatial variability in plant phenology. By highlighting the spatial dimension of trophic mismatch, these results reveal heretofore unexpected adverse consequences of climatic warming for herbivore population ecology.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater} High alpine plants endure a cold climate with short growing seasons entailing severe consequences of an improper timing of development. Hence, their flowering phenology is expected to be rigorously controlled by climatic factors. We studied ten alpine plant species from habitats with early and late melting snow cover for 2 years and compared the synchronizing effect of temperature sums (TS), time of snowmelt (SM) and photoperiod (PH) on their flowering phenology. Intraseasonal and habitat-specific variation in the impact of these factors was analysed by comparing predictions of time-to-event models using linear mixed-effects models. Temperature was the overwhelming trigger of flowering phenology for all species. Its synchronizing effect was strongest at or shortly after flowering indicating the particular importance of phenological control of pollination. To some extent, this pattern masks the common trend of decreasing phenological responses to climatic changes from the beginning to the end of the growing season for lowland species. No carry-over effects were detected. As expected, the impact of photoperiod was weaker for snowbed species than for species inhabiting sites with early melting snow cover, while for temperature the reverse pattern was observed. Our findings provide strong evidence that alpine plants will respond quickly and directly to increasing temperature without considerable compensation due to photoperiodic control of phenology.},

Time-sensitive relationships, such as migration, breeding and predation, may be disrupted or altered, which may in turn alter the rates of reproduction and survival, leading some populations to decline and others to increase in abundance. However, finding evidence for disrupted relationships, or lack thereof, and their demographic effects, is difficult because the necessary detailed observational data are rare. Moreover, we do not know how sensitive species will generally be to phenological mismatches when they occur. Existing long-term studies provide preliminary data for analysing the phenology and demography of species in several locations. In many instances, though, observational protocols may need to be optimized to characterize timing-based multi-trophic interactions. As a basis for future research, we outline some of the key questions and approaches to improving our understanding of the relationships among phenology, demography and climate in a multi-trophic context. There are many challenges associated with this line of research, not the least of which is the need for detailed, long-term data on many organisms in a single system. However, we identify key questions that can be addressed with data that already exist and propose approaches that could guide future research.},

abstract = {Snow is an important environmental factor in alpine ecosystems, which influences plant phenology, growth and species composition in various ways. With current climate warming, the snow-to-rain ratio is decreasing, and the timing of snowmelt advancing. In a 2-year field experiment above treeline in the Swiss Alps, we investigated how a substantial decrease in snow depth and an earlier snowmelt affect plant phenology, growth, and reproduction of the four most abundant dwarf-shrub species in an alpine tundra community. By advancing the timing when plants started their growing season and thus lost their winter frost hardiness, earlier snowmelt also changed the number of low-temperature events they experienced while frost sensitive. This seemed to outweigh the positive effects of a longer growing season and hence, aboveground growth was reduced after advanced snowmelt in three of the four species studied. Only Loiseleuria procumbens, a specialist of wind exposed sites with little snow, benefited from an advanced snowmelt. We conclude that changes in the snow cover can have a wide range of species-specific effects on alpine tundra plants. Thus, changes in winter climate and snow cover characteristics should be taken into account when predicting climate change effects on alpine ecosystems.},

There is clear evidence of recent declines in both wild and domesticated pollinators, and parallel declines in the plants that rely upon them. Here we describe the nature and extent of reported declines, and review the potential drivers of pollinator loss, including habitat loss and fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens, alien species, climate change and the interactions between them. Pollinator declines can result in loss of pollination services which have important negative ecological and economic impacts that could significantly affect the maintenance of wild plant diversity, wider ecosystem stability, crop production, food security and human welfare. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Snow-cover is of significance not only to climate but also to hydrological and ecological systems through its control of the insulating, reflective and water storage properties at the surface of the Earth. In summer, solar radiation is the most important factor in the arctic energy budget. However, the amount of energy available for driving the soil surface systems depends on the albedo of the surface. The albedo of snow is 60-90{\%}, whereas the albedo in snow-free areas is of the order of 10-20{\%}. The energy budget for a given region is therefore strongly coupled to the fraction of snow-covered ground. By use of different kinds of remote-sensing data (Landsat TM/ETM+, SPOT HRV and Digital Camera Images), the inter- and intra-annual snow-cover distribution in Zackenbergdalen has been monitored. Based on the digital camera data, a model of snow-cover depletion was developed to extend the time series of snow coverage (during melt-off) back in time. The model uses an interpolated data set, which includes information on melt energy and end-of-winter snow amounts, to calculate spatial snow-cover extent during the melting season. The results showed that the date with 50{\%} snow-cover in Zackenbergdalen fluctuated within a margin of approximately ±2 weeks around the mean, which was June 21. During the cold season at high latitudes, short-wave radiation is of minor importance in the energy budget, due to the low sun. Results show that during the winter season, heat advection caused by atmospheric circulation, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), may be important in some periods, and that the sea ice conditions in the south-eastern part of the Greenland Sea might be crucial for the winter precipitation budget in Northeast Greenland; that is, significant correlations (R
                        2 = 0.5-0.6) between snow accumulation at Zackenberg and sea ice cover to the east and southeast of Zackenberg was found, showing that reduced amounts of sea ice in the region may be likely to lead to increased snow precipitation. This effect may counteract the expected prolonged average length of the snow-free (growing) season in high-arctic Northeast Greenland in a future climate with higher temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming.

abstract = {Aim Our understanding of the ecology and biogeography of microbes, including those that cause human disease, lags behind that for larger species. Despite recent focus on the geographical distribution of viruses and bacteria, the overall environmental distribution of human pathogens and parasites on Earth remains incompletely understood. As islands have long inspired basic ecological insights, we aimed to assess whether the microorganisms that cause human disease in modern times follow patterns common to insular plants and animals. Location Global and regional. Methods Relying on the publically accessible GIDEON database, we use the spatial distribution of nearly 300 human parasites and pathogens across 66 island countries and territories to assess the current predictive value of the ‘equilibrium theory' of island biogeography. The relationships between species richness and (1) island surface area and (2) distance to the nearest mainland were investigated with linear regression, and ANCOVAs were used to test for differences in these relationships with respect to pathogen ecology and taxonomy. Results Pathogen species richness increases with island surface area and decreases with distance to the nearest mainland. The effect of area is more than 10 times lower than that usually reported for macroorganisms, but is greater than the effect of distance. The strongest relationships are for pathogens that are vector-borne, zoonotic (with humans as dead-end hosts) or protozoan. Main conclusion Our results support the basic predictions of the theory: disease diversity is a positive function of island area and a negative function of island isolation. However, differences in the effects of area, distance and pathogen ecology suggest that globalization, probably through human travel and the animal trade, has softened these relationships. Parasites that primarily target non-human species, whose distributions are more constrained by island life than are those restricted to human hosts, drive the island biogeography of human disease.},

abstract = {Climate warming affects the phenology, local abundance and large-scale distribution of plants and pollinators. Despite this, there is still limited knowledge of how elevated temperatures affect plant-pollinator mutualisms and how changed availability of mutualistic partners influences the persistence of interacting species. Here we review the evidence of climate warming effects on plants and pollinators and discuss how their interactions may be affected by increased temperatures. The onset of flowering in plants and first appearance dates of pollinators in several cases appear to advance linearly in response to recent temperature increases. Phenological responses to climate warming may therefore occur at parallel magnitudes in plants and pollinators, although considerable variation in responses across species should be expected. Despite the overall similarities in responses, a few studies have shown that climate warming may generate temporal mismatches among the mutualistic partners. Mismatches in pollination interactions are still rarely explored and their demographic consequences are largely unknown. Studies on multi-species plant-pollinator assemblages indicate that the overall structure of pollination networks probably are robust against perturbations caused by climate warming. We suggest potential ways of studying warming-caused mismatches and their consequences for plant-pollinator interactions, and highlight the strengths and limitations of such approaches.},

abstract = {Ecological networks of two interacting guilds of species, such as flowering plants and pollinators, are common in nature, and studying their structure can yield insights into their resilience to environmental disturbances. Here we develop analytical methods for exploring the strengths of interactions within bipartite networks consisting of two guilds of phylogenetically related species. We then apply these methods to investigate the resilience of a plant-pollinator community to anticipated climate change. The methods allow the statistical assessment of, for example, whether closely related pollinators are more likely to visit plants with similar relative frequencies, and whether closely related pollinators tend to visit closely related plants. The methods can also incorporate trait information, allowing us to identify which plant traits are likely responsible for attracting different pollinators. These questions are important for our study of 14 prairie plants and their 22 insect pollinators. Over the last 70 years, six of the plants have advanced their flowering, while eight have not. When we experimentally forced earlier flowering times, five of the six advanced-flowering species experienced higher pollinator visitation rates, whereas only one of the eight other species had more visits; this network thus appears resilient to climate change, because those species with advanced flowering have ample pollinators earlier in the season. Using the methods developed here, we show that advanced-flowering plants did not have a distinct pollinator community from the other eight species. Furthermore, pollinator phylogeny did not explain pollinator community composition; closely related pollinators were not more likely to visit the same plant species. However, differences among pollinator communities visiting different plants were explained by plant height, floral color, and symmetry. As a result, closely related plants attracted similar numbers of pollinators. By parsing out characteristics that explain why plants share pollinators, we can identify plant species that likely share a common fate in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Recent changes in the seasonal timing (phenology) of familiar biological events have been one of the most conspicuous signs of climate change. However, the lack of a standardized approach to analysing change has hampered assessment of consistency in such changes among different taxa and trophic levels and across freshwater, terrestrial and marine environments. We present a standardized assessment of 25 532 rates of phenological change for 726 UK terrestrial, freshwater and marine taxa. The majority of spring and summer events have advanced, and more rapidly than previously documented. Such consistency is indicative of shared large scale drivers. Furthermore, average rates of change have accelerated in a way that is consistent with observed warming trends. Less coherent patterns in some groups of organisms point to the agency of more local scale processes and multiple drivers. For the first time we show a broad scale signal of differential phenological change among trophic levels; across environments advances in timing were slowest for secondary consumers, thus heightening the potential risk of temporal mismatch in key trophic interactions. If current patterns and rates of phenological change are indicative of future trends, future climate warming may exacerbate trophic mismatching, further disrupting the functioning, persistence and resilience of many ecosystems and having a major impact on ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Recent anthropogenic climate change is strongly associated with average shifts toward earlier seasonal timing of activity (phenology) in temperate-zone species. Shifts in phenology have the potential to alter ecological interactions, to the detriment of one or more interacting species. Recent models predict that detrimental phenological mismatch may increasingly occur between plants and their pollinators. One way to test this prediction is to examine data from ecological communities that experience large annual weather fluctuations. Taking this approach, we analyzed interactions over a four-year period among 132 plant species and 665 pollinating insect species within a Mediterranean community. For each plant species we recorded onset and duration of flowering and number of pollinator species. Flowering onset varied among years, and a year of earlier flowering of a species tended to be a year of fewer species pollinating its flowers. This relationship was attributable principally to early-flowering species, suggesting that shifts toward earlier phenology driven by climate change may reduce pollination services due to phenological mismatch. Earlier flowering onset of a species also was associated with prolonged flowering duration, but it is not certain that this will counterbalance any negative effects of lower pollinator species richness on plant reproductive success. Among plants with different life histories, annuals were more severely affected by flowering-pollinator mismatches than perennials. Specialized plant species (those attracting a smaller number of pollinator species) did not experience disproportionate interannual fluctuations in phenology. Thus they do not appear to be faced with disproportionate fluctuations in pollinator species richness, contrary to the expectation that specialists are at greatest risk of losing mutualistic interactions because of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Despite uncertainties in the magnitude of expected global warming over the next century, one consistent feature of extant and projected changes is that Arctic environments are and will be exposed to the greatest warming [1]. Concomitant with such large abiotic changes, biological responses to warming at high northern latitudes are also expected to outpace those at lower latitudes. One of the clearest and most rapid signals of biological response to rising temperatures across an array of biomes has been shifts in species phenology [2-4], yet to date evidence for phenological responses to climate change has been presented from most biomes except the High Arctic [3]. Given the well-established consequences for population dynamics of shifts in the timing of life history events [5,6], it is essential that the High Arctic be represented in assessments of phenological response to climate change. Using the most comprehensive data set available from this region, we document extremely rapid climate-induced advancement of flowering, emergence and egg-laying in a wide array of species in a high-arctic ecosystem. The strong responses and the large variability within species and taxa illustrate how easily biological interactions may be disrupted by abiotic forcing, and how dramatic responses to climatic changes can be for arctic ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Climate change can aff ect plant – pollinator interactions in a variety of ways, but much of the research attention has focused on whether independent shifts in phenology will alter temporal overlap between plants and pollinators. Here I review the research on plant – pollinator mismatch, assessing the potential for observational and experimental approaches to address particular aspects of the problem. Recent, primarily observational studies suggest that phenologies of co-occurring plants and pollinators tend to respond similarly to environmental cues, but that nevertheless, certain pairs of interacting species are showing independent shifts in phenology. Only in a few cases, however, have these independent shifts been shown to aff ect population vital rates (specifi cally, seed production by plants) – but this largely refl ects a lack of research. Compared to the few long-term studies of pollination in natural plant populations, experimental manipulations of phenology have yielded relatively optimistic conclusions about eff ects of phenological shifts on plant reproduction, and I discuss how issues of scale and frequency-dependence in pollinator behaviour aff ect the interpretation of these ‘ temporal transplant ' experiments. Comparable research on the impacts of mismatch on pollinator populations is so far lacking, but both observational studies and focused experiments have the potential to improve our forecasts of pollinator responses to changing phenologies. Finally, while there is now evidence that plant – pollinator mismatch can aff ect seed production by plants, it is still unclear whether this phenological impact will be the primary way in which climate change aff ects plant – pollinator interactions. It would be useful to test the direct eff ects of changing climate on pollinator population persistence, and to compare the importance of phenological mismatch with other threats to pollination.},

Here we investigate the population consequences of such mistiming in the migratory pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca4 . In a comparison of nine Dutch populations, we find that populations have declined by about 90{\%} over the past two decades in areas where the food for provisioning nestlings peaks early in the season and the birds are currently mistimed. In areas with a late food peak, early-breeding birds still breed at the right time, and there is, at most, a weak population decline. If food phenology advances further, we also predict population declines in areaswith a late food peak, as in these areas adjustment to an advanced food peak is insufficient4 . Mistiming as a result of climate change is probably a widespread phenomenon1 , and here we provide evidence that it can lead to population declines.},

abstract = {Networks from a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems have been recently described as ''small-world'' and ''scale-free.'' However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called food webs possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagree-ments are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25–172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal func-tional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power–law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.},

abstract = {Uncovering the processes that shape the architecture of interaction networks is a major challenge in ecology. Studies have consistently revealed that more closely related taxa tend to show greater overlap in interaction partners, fuelling the idea that interactions are phylogenetically conserved [1-8]. However, local ecological processes such as exploitative or apparent competition (indirect interactions) might instead cause a decrease in overlap in interacting partners. Because of the taxonomic and geographic coarseness of existing studies [2-5, 7], the structuring effect of such processes has been overlooked. Here, we assess the relative importance of phylogeny and ecological processes in a local, highly resolved, four-level antagonistic network. Across all network levels we consistently find that phylogenetic relatedness among resource species is correlated with consumer overlap but that phylogenetic relatedness among consumer species is not or negatively correlated with resource overlap. This pervasive pattern indicates that the antagonistic network has been shaped by both phylogeny on resource range and by exploitative competition limiting resource overlap among closely related consumer species. Intriguingly, the strength of phylogenetic signal varies in a consistent way across the network levels. We discuss the generality of our findings and their implications in a changing world. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity, ecological sorting, and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance of ecological sorting processes (community assembly, migration, habitat tracking, etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities, plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are well adapted, so their distributions, and the distributions of associated functional traits, will reflect the distribution of optimal or near‐optimal environmental conditions in space and time.

abstract = {The past 30 years have seen a revolution in comparative biology. Before that time, systematics was not at the forefront of the biological sciences, and few scientists considered phylogenetic relationships when investigating evolutionary questions. By contrast, systematic biology is now one of the most vigorous disciplines in biology, and the use of phylogenies not only is requisite in macroevolutionary studies but also has been applied to a wide range of topics and fields that no one could possibly have envisioned 30 years ago. My message is simple: phylogenies are fundamental to comparative biology, but they are not the be-all and end-all. Phylogenies are powerful tools for understanding the past, but like any tool, they have their limitations. In addition, phylogenies are much more informative about pattern than they are about process. The best way to fully understand the past-both pattern and process-is to integrate phylogenies with other types of historical data as well as with direct studies of evolutionary process.},

abstract = {1. Species community composition is known to alter the network of interactions between two tro- phic levels, potentially affecting its functioning (e.g. plant pollination success) and the stability of communities. Phylogenies vary in shape with regard to the rate of evolutionary change across a tree (influencing tree balance) and variation in the timing of branching events (affecting the distribution of node ages in trees), both of which may influence the structure of species interaction networks. Because related species are likely to share many of the traits that regulate interactions, the shape of phylogenetic trees may provide some insights into the distribution of traits within communities, and hence the likelihood of interaction among species. However, little attention has been paid to the potential effects of changes in phylogenetic diversity (PD) on interaction networks. 2. Phylogenetic diversity is influenced by species diversity within a community, but also how dis- tantly-related the constituent species are from one another. Here, we evaluate the relationship between two important measures of phylogenetic diversity (tree shape and age of nodes) and the structure of plant–pollinator interaction networks using empirical and simulated data. Whereas the former allows us to evaluate patterns in real communities, the latter allows us to evaluate more systematically the relationship between tree shape and network structure under three different models of trait evolution. 3. In empirical networks, less balanced plant phylogenies were associated with lower connectance in interaction networks indicating that communities with the descendants of recent radiations are more diverged and specialized in their partnerships. In simulations, tree balance and the distribution of nodes through time were included in the best models for modularity, and the second best models for connectance and nestedness. In models assuming random evolutionary change through time (i.e. Brownian motion), less balanced trees and trees with nodes near the tips exhibited greater modular- ity, whereas in models with an early burst of radiation followed by relative stasis (i.e. early-burst models) more balanced trees and trees with nodes near roots had greater modularity. 4. Synthesis. Overall, these results suggest that the shape of phylogenies can influence the structure of plant–pollinator interaction networks. However, the mismatch between simulations and empirical data indicate that no simple model of trait evolution mimics that observed in real communities.},

Here we investigated the radiation of sexually deceptive bee orchids (Ophrys). Based on a time-calibrated phylogeny and by means of ancestral character reconstruction and divergence time estimation, we estimated the tempo and mode of this radiation within a state-dependent evolutionary framework. It appears that, in the Pleistocene, the evolution of Ophrys was marked by episodes of rapid diversification coinciding with shifts to different pollinator types: from wasps to Eucera bees to Andrena and other bees. An abrupt increase in net diversification rate was detected in three clades. Among these, two phylogenetically distant lineages switched from Eucera to Andrena and other bees in a parallel fashion and at about the same time in their evolutionary history. Lack of early radiation associated with the evolution of the key innovation of sexual decep- tion suggests that Ophrys diversification was mainly driven by subsequent ecological opportu- nities provided by the exploitation of novel pollinator groups, encompassing many bee species slightly differing in their sex pheromone communication systems, and by spatiotemporal fluc- tuations in the pollinator mosaic.},

abstract = {Many major branches in the Tree of Life are marked by stereotyped body plans that have been maintained over long periods of time. One possible explanation for this stasis is that there are genetic or developmental constraints that restrict the origin of novel body plans. An alternative is that basic body plans are potentially quite labile, but are actively maintained by natural selection. We present evidence that the conserved floral morphology of a species-rich flowering plant clade, Malpighiaceae, has been actively maintained for tens of millions of years via stabilizing selection imposed by their specialist New World oil-bee pollinators. Nine clades that have lost their primary oil-bee pollinators show major evolutionary shifts in specific floral traits associated with oil-bee pollination, demonstrating that developmental constraint is not the primary cause of morphological stasis in Malpighiaceae. Interestingly, Malpighiaceae show a burst in species diversification coinciding with the origin of this plant-pollinator mutualism. One hypothesis to account for radiation despite morphological stasis is that although selection on pollinator efficiency explains the origin of this unique and conserved floral morphology, tight pollinator specificity subsequently permitted greatly enhanced diversification in this system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plant-feeding insects make up a large part of earth's total biodiversity. While it has been shown that herbivory has repeatedly led to increased diversification rates in insects, there has been no compelling explanation for how plant-feeding has promoted speciation rates. There is a growing awareness that ecological factors can lead to rapid diversification and, as one of the most prominent features of most insect-plant interactions, specialization onto a diverse resource has often been assumed to be the main process behind this diversification. However, specialization is mainly a pruning process, and is not able to actually generate diversity by itself. Here we investigate the role of host colonizations in generating insect diversity, by testing if insect speciation rate is correlated with resource diversity. RESULTS: By applying a variant of independent contrast analysis, specially tailored for use on questions of species richness (MacroCAIC), we show that species richness is strongly correlated with diversity of host use in the butterfly family Nymphalidae. Furthermore, by comparing the results from reciprocal sister group selection, where sister groups were selected either on the basis of diversity of host use or species richness, we find that it is likely that diversity of host use is driving species richness, rather than vice versa. CONCLUSION: We conclude that resource diversity is correlated with species richness in the Nymphalidae and suggest a scenario based on recurring oscillations between host expansions - the incorporation of new plants into the repertoire - and specialization, as an important driving force behind the diversification of plant-feeding insects.},

abstract = {Environmental filtering is a fundamental process in the ecological assembly of communities. Recently developed phylogenetic tools identify patterns associated with environmental filtering across whole communities. Here we introduce a novel method that allows the detection of traits involved in the environmental filtering of species from specific clades in specific habitat types. Our approach identifies nonindependent trait/habitat/clade (THC) associations and also provides a framework for detecting clearly defined two-way trait/clade, trait/habitat, and clade/habitat associations. The THC method relies on exact binomial tests and differentiates THC associations resulting from a three-way interaction from those that are generated by one or more underlying significant two-way interactions. It can also detect THC associations for which there are no significant two-way associations (trait/habitat, trait/clade, clade/habitat). To illustrate the THC method, we examine plant pollination and dispersal traits from six habitat types in a fragmented Costa Rican landscape. Results suggest that these traits are not widely important for the environmental filtering of most clades in this landscape, but animal dispersal and insect pollination are involved in the filtering of monocots and the Piperaceae in rain forest understory.},

The study of the impact of herbivory on plant fitness and its relationship with environmental conditions is essential to an understanding of the ecological and evolutionary routes in different populations of the same plant species. This paper addresses the effects of herbivory and environment on growth (leaf production) and floral display (inflorescence production) in the tropical aroid Anthurium schlechtendalii ssp. schlechtendalii Kunth (Araceae). 2. Defoliation experiments were conducted in three natural A. schlechtendalii populations in Mexico: coastal sand dunes (Telchac); thorny dry forest (Dzemul); and mediumheight subhumid forest (Hobonil). Experiments were also conducted under commongarden conditions using plants transplanted from the three populations. 3. Logistic regression models showed that herbivory did not affect growth negatively, but did affect floral display in A. schlechtendalii. The effect on floral display differed as a function of environment, damage intensity and season. When the plants experienced no resource limitation (common garden), herbivory inhibited inflorescence production in the first season (2001) and at the highest damage level (75{\%}). When plants experienced heterogeneous resource conditions (field experiment), inflorescence production was inhibited in the second season (2002) at intermediate damage intensities. 4. Overall, A. schlechtendalii plants maintained growth regardless of damage intensity, but inflorescence production was reduced, indicating a trade-off between growth and floral display due to herbivory. Results also suggested that plants were constrained in their response by the environmental history of their native site.},

We determined the effect of nutrients and leaf herbivory by Manduca sexta on Nicotiana tabacum nectar and leaf alkaloids, floral traits and moth oviposition. We found a positive phenotypic correlation between nectar and leaf alkaloids. Herbivory induced alkaloids in nectar but not in leaves, while nutrients increased alkaloids in both tissues. Moths laid the most eggs on damaged, fertilized plants, suggesting a preference for high alkaloids. Induced nectar alkaloids via leaf herbivory indicate that species interactions involving leaf and floral tissues are linked and should not be treated as independent phenomena in plant ecology or evolution.},

Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The relationship between the structure of ecological networks and community stability has been studied for decades. Recent developments highlighted that this relationship depended on whether interactions were antagonistic or mutualistic. Different structures promoting stability in different types of ecological networks, i.e. mutualistic or antagonistic, have been pointed out. However, these findings come from studies considering mutualistic and antagonistic interactions separately whereas we know that species are part of both types of networks simultaneously. Understanding the relationship between network structure and community stability, when mutualistic and antagonistic interactions are merged in a single network, thus appears as the next challenge to improve our understanding of the dynamics of natural communities. Using a theoretical approach, we test whether the structural characteristics known to promote stability in networks made of a single interaction type still hold for network merging mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. We show that the effects of diversity and connectance remain unchanged. But the effects of nestedness and modularity are strongly weakened in networks combining mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. By challenging the stabilizing mechanisms proposed for networks with a single interaction type, our study calls for new measures of structure for networks that integrate the diversity of interaction.},

abstract = {Traits that are attractive to mutualists may also attract antagonists, resulting in conflicting selection pressures. Here we develop the idea that increased floral nectar production can, in some cases, increase herbivory. In these situations, selection for increased nectar production to attract pollinators may be constrained by a linked cost of herbivore attraction. In support of this hypothesis, we report that experimentally supplementing nectar rewards in Datura stramonium led to increased oviposition by Manduca sexta, a sphingid moth that pollinates flowers, but whose larvae feed on leaf tissue. We speculate that nectar composition may provide information about plant nutritional status or defense that floral visitors could use to make oviposition decisions. Thus, selection by floral visitors and leaf herbivores may be inextricably intertwined, and herbivores may represent a relatively un- explored agent of selection on nectar traits.},

abstract = {Plants interact with many visitors who consume a variety of plant tissues. While the consequences of herbivory to leaves and shoots are well known, the implications of florivory, the consumption of flowers prior to seed coat formation, have received less attention. Herbivory and florivory can yield different plant, population and community outcomes; thus, it is critical to distinguish between these two types of consumption. Here, we consider the ecological and evolutionary consequences of florivory. A growing number of studies recognize that florivory is common in natural systems and in some cases surpasses leaf herbivory in magnitude and impact. Florivores can affect male and female plant fitness via direct trophic effects and through altered pathways of species interactions. In particular, florivory can affect pollination and have consequences for plant mating and floral sexual system evolution. Plants are not defenceless against florivore damage. Concepts of resistance and tolerance can be applied to plant-florivore interactions. Moreover, extant theories of plant chemical defence, including optimal defence theory, growth rate hypothesis and growth differentiation-balance hypothesis, can be used to make testable predictions about when and how plants should defend flowers against florivores. The majority of the predictions remain untested, but they provide a theoretical foundation on which to base future experiments. The approaches to studying florivory that we outline may yield novel insights into floral and defence traits not illuminated by studies of pollination or herbivory alone.},

abstract = {It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67{\%} to 96{\%} but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78{\%} in temperate-zone communities to 94{\%} in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5{\%} of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant-pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems},

abstract = {Herbivores can consume significant amounts of plant biomass in many environments. Yet plants are not defenseless against such attack. Although defenses might benefit plants in the presence of herbivores, herbivore attack varies both spatially and temporally, and the expression of plant resistance to herbivores can be costly in the absence of plant enemies. Costs can be described as allocation costs, resource-based tradeoffs between resistance and fitness, or as ecological costs, decreases in fitness resulting from interactions with other species. Here, we update the seminal 1996 Bergelson and Purrington review of resistance costs and find that many more studies have documented costs of resistance (sensu lato) than found during the 1996 survey. Eighty-two percent of studies in which genetic background is controlled, demonstrate significant fitness reductions associated with herbivore resistance. We categorize studies by type of resistance, induced or constitutive, by type of cost, and also by the degree to which investigators controlled for genetic background. Recent work has commonly detected both direct resistance costs, such as resource-based tradeoffs, and ecological costs, which depend on interactions with other species.},

@article{Mitchell2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Co-flowering plant species frequently share pollinators. Pollinator sharing is often detrimental to one or more of these species, leading to competition for pollination. Perhaps because it offers an intriguing juxtaposition of ecological opposites - mutualism and competition - within one relatively tractable system, competition for pollination has captured the interest of ecologists for over a century. SCOPE: Our intent is to contemplate exciting areas for further work on competition for pollination, rather than to exhaustively review past studies. After a brief historical summary, we present a conceptual framework that incorporates many aspects of competition for pollination, involving both the quantity and quality of pollination services, and both female and male sex functions of flowers. Using this framework, we contemplate a relatively subtle mechanism of competition involving pollen loss, and consider how competition might affect plant mating systems, overall reproductive success and multi-species interactions. We next consider how competition for pollination might be altered by several emerging consequences of a changing planet, including the spread of alien species, climate change and pollinator declines. Most of these topics represent new frontiers whose exploration has just begun. CONCLUSIONS: Competition for pollination has served as a model for the integration of ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the study of species interactions. Its study has elucidated both obvious and more subtle mechanisms, and has documented a range of outcomes. However, the potential for this interaction to inform our understanding of both pure and applied aspects of pollination biology has only begun to be realized.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that the understory herbs Costus allenii and C. laevis (Zingiberaceae) have converged in floral characteristics to use the same pollinator was investigated in central Panama. Observations and experiments indicated that these species (1) occupy the same habitats, (2) flower synchronously, (3) are identical in flower color, morphology, and nectar secretion patterns, (4) share the same pollinator, the bee Euglossa imperialis, (5) are self-compatible, but not autogamous, and (6) have strong barriers to hybridization. Both grow in low density along streamsides and produce a single flower per day for an extended period (up to 4 mo). Flower density is depressed through extensive predation by the weevil Cholus cinctus, which damaged 31{\%} of all C. allenii and 60{\%} of all C. laevis inflorescences. Direct observation of foraging bees indicated that individuals regularly visit both plant species. An experimental analysis of interspecific pollen transfer using powered paint as a marker verified these results; 97{\%} of the flowers checked had received heterospecific visits. The high probability of interspecific pollination did not affect fruiting success. I suggest that low flower density, exaggerated by extreme floral predation, has selected for floral similarity and pollinator sharing in these species. Floral convergence increases effective flower density and nectar supplies, and probably increases the regularity and rate of pollinator visitation.},

abstract = {* The evolution of self-pollination has long been considered an adaptive strategy to cope with low or variable pollinator service; however, alternative reproductive strategies, such as generalized pollination ({\textgreater}1 pollinator functional group), may also ensure plant reproductive success in environments with inadequate pollinator visitation. * Island–mainland systems provide ideal settings to assess the interaction between pollination and breeding systems in response to pollinator visitation because islands are often pollinator-depauperate. This study compared 28 insular and 26 mainland species of Caribbean Gesneriaceae to test the hypothesis that low diversity and possibly low pollinator service on islands would lead to a greater frequency of generalized plant–pollinator interactions and/or a higher potential for autonomous self-pollination in insular than in mainland species. We also assessed the hypothesis that epiphytic species should have greater autofertility than species occurring in other habitats. * Pollinator observations conducted in the field from 2004 to 2014 revealed bat, bee, butterfly, hummingbird, moth, and generalized pollination systems. Functional specialization in pollination systems was high in insular (71{\%} of the species) and mainland sites (all species), but generalized and bat-pollinated species were more common on islands. Overall, pollinator visitation rates did not differ between island and mainland; however, for hummingbird-pollinated species, visitation rate was on average three times higher in mainland than island species. Autofertility indices (fruit set of bagged/outcross flowers) ranged from 0 to 1 and did not differ between island and mainland species. Species growing on rocks (rupiculous) and trees (epiphytic) had on average higher autofertility than terrestrial species. * Synthesis. This study revealed that alternative reproductive strategies are used in pollinator-depauperate environments. Pollinator visitation is lower in insular hummingbird-pollinated species (the ancestral pollination system of insular Gesneriaceae); therefore, generalized pollination may be considered a reproductive assurance mechanism evolved primarily on island environments. Contrary to the long-standing tenet, however, autonomous self-pollination was similar in island and mainland Gesneriaceae suggesting that: (i) generalized pollination provides a viable alternative to selfing in pollinator-depauperate environments, (ii) autofertility as a reproductive assurance mechanism may be frequent in plant species from mainland regions in environments with unpredictable pollinator visitation and resource availability.},

abstract = {The study explores whether or not there are convergent patterns in floral scent composition among plant species that completely or partially rely on butterflies for pollination. Floral scent compounds were analysed from 22 flowering butterfly-pollinated plant species, representing 13 families which originate mainly from temperate North Europe but also from tropical and temperate America. Scents were collected using the dynamic headspace adsorption method and identified with coupled gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In total, 217 floral scent compounds were identified, with the number per species ranging from 8 to 65. The major emerging pattern is the occurrence of certain compounds emitted exclusively by the flowers of many of the investigated species in major amounts - the benzenoids phenylacetaldehyde and 2-phenylethanol, the monoterpenes linalool and linalool oxide (furanoid) I and II and the irregular terpene oxoisophorone. It is likely that these compounds serve as a signal to attract pollinating butterflies, and may have evolved in conjunction with the sensory capabilities of butterflies as a specific group of pollinators. While there is convergence in terms of the compounds sharing this function there has been a geographical divergence in terms of their relative abundance. The predominance (in terms of both numbers and relative amount) of benzenoids in many of the scent blends of the European temperate species and of linalool and its derivatives in those of the American species constitute two discernible groups among these plants.

abstract = {We studied the pollination ecology of nine species of red, tubular flowers which bloom together in different combinations in the White Mountains of Arizona, USA. All species were strikingly convergent in floral color, size, and shape. Hummingbirds, the primary pollinators, usually did not visit flower species selectively, and individual birds often simultaneously carried four or more species of pollen. Flowers may have competed interspecifically for these shared pollinators, but competition was reduced because character displacement in orientation of anthers and stigma resulted in some species using different parts of the bird to transport their pollen. Most flower species secreted nectar at similar rates, particularly when the bloomed together in mixed stands. A population of Lobelia cardinalis secreted no nectar; it attracted hummingbirds by mimicing more abundant, nectar—producing species. This temperate flower community, which resembles some associations of convergent Mullerian and Batesian mimics, appear to have evolved its characteristics convergent structure because the advantages of using similar signals and rewards to share the same hummingbird pollinators outweigh the advantages of diverging to reduce interspecific competition.

At the same time, biologists working mainly in the tropics and the species-rich temperate floras of the Southern hemisphere are documenting pollination systems that are remarkably specialized, often involving a single pollinator species. Current studies are aimed at understanding: (1) the ecological forces that have favoured either generalization or specialization in particular lineages and regions; (2) the implications for selection on floral traits and divergence of populations; and (3) the risk of collapse in plant-pollinator mutualisms of varying specificity.},

To investigate how coevolutionary interactions are shaped within species-rich communities, we characterized the architecture of an array of quantitative, mutualistic networks spanning a broad geographic range. These coevolutionary networks are highly asymmetric, so that if a plant species depends strongly on an animal species, the animal depends weakly on the plant. By using a simple dynamical model, we showed that asymmetries inherent in coevolutionary networks may enhance long-term coexistence and facilitate biodiversity maintenance.},

@article{Armbruster1997,
abstract = {To evaluate possible evolutionary links between plant–herbivore and plant–pollinator relationships, defense and reward characteristics and pollination ecology were mapped onto a morphologically estimated phylogeny of 42 species of Dalechampia. This procedure generated detailed hypotheses about the evolution of anti-herbivore defense and pollination systems. These hypotheses were tested using the results of chemical analyses and bioassays of foliar and floral secretions. Multiple lines of defense appear to have evolved in sequence in Dalechampia. The first defense system to originate was deployment of triterpene resins to defend the staminate flowers. This feature was a preaptation (preadaptation) that allowed the evolution of a resin-based, pollinator-reward system. Thus pollination by resin-collecting bees originated as a “transfer exaptation” (a new function replaced the old). This hypothesis is supported by anti-herbivore activities of floral resins and by chemical similarity of floral defense and reward resins. After the resin defense of flowers was lost by conversion into a reward system, there followed (in evolutionary time) a sequence of defensive innovations. These included nocturnal closure of large, involucral bracts to protect both staminate and pistillate flowers. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the large bracts themselves probably originated as a floral advertisement system, and the bracts assumed a defensive function through “addition exaptation” (a new function was added to the old). Additional lines of defense to evolve were deployment of resin to defend the developing ovaries and seeds (an addition exaptation), deployment of sharp, detaching trichomes on enveloping sepals to defend developing seeds (apparent adaptations), closure of involucral bracts around the developing fruits and seeds (an addition exaptation), and deployment of resin to defend the leaves and growing shoot tips (also an addition exaptation). Support for this scenario also derives from the chemical similarities of sepal, foliar, and floral resins, and the anti-herbivore properties of foliar resins. It appears that at least one pollinator-reward system originated by modification of a defense system, and several defense systems originated by modification of pollinator reward and advertisement systems. Thus exaptations have been important in the origin of new defense and pollination systems, and each system has significantly influenced the evolution of the other on several occasions.},

abstract = {Plants and their herbivores constitute more than half of the organisms in tropical forests. Therefore, a better understanding of the evolution of plant defenses against their herbivores may be central for our understanding of tropical biodiversity. Here, we address the evolution of antiherbivore defenses and their possible contribution to coexistence in the Neotropical tree genus Inga (Fabaceae). Inga has {\textgreater}300 species, has radiated recently, and is frequently one of the most diverse and abundant genera at a given site. For 37 species from Panama and Peru we characterized developmental, ant, and chemical defenses against herbivores. We found extensive variation in defenses, but little evidence of phylogenetic signal. Furthermore, in a multivariate analysis, developmental, ant, and chemical defenses varied independently (were orthogonal) and appear to have evolved independently of each other. Our results are consistent with strong selection for divergent defensive traits, presumably mediated by herbivores. In an analysis of community assembly, we found that Inga species co-occurring as neighbors are more different in antiherbivore defenses than random, suggesting that possessing a rare defense phenotype increases fitness. These results imply that interactions with herbivores may be an important axis of niche differentiation that permits the coexistence of many species of Inga within a single site. Interactions between plants and their herbivores likely play a key role in the generation and maintenance of the conspicuously high plant diversity in the tropics.},

Despite a long-standing discussion in the literature on the subject, no study to date has specifically manipulated specialist and generalist herbivores independently of one another to determine whether the two guilds exert opposing selection pressures on specific defensive traits. In two separate experiments, the dominant specialist and generalist herbivores of Brassica nigra were independently manipulated to test whether the composition of the herbivore community altered the direction of selection on a major defensive trait of the plant, sinigrin concentration. It was found that generalist damage was negatively correlated but specialist loads were positively correlated with increasing sinigrin concentrations; and sinigrin concentration was favored when specialists were removed, disfavored (past an intermediate point) when generalists were removed and selectively neutral when plants faced both generalists and specialists.},

abstract = {Ecological interactions are crucial to understanding both the ecology and the evolution of organisms. Because the phenotypic traits regulating species interactions are largely a legacy of their ancestors, it is widely assumed that ecological interactions are phylogenetically conserved, with closely related species interacting with similar partners. However, the existing empirical evidence is inadequate to appropriately evaluate the hypothesis of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological interactions, because it is both ecologically and taxonomically biased. In fact, most studies on the evolution of ecological interactions have focused on specialized organisms, such as some parasites or insect herbivores, belonging to a limited subset of the overall tree of life. Here we study the evolution of host use in a large and diverse group of interactions comprising both specialist and generalist acellular, unicellular and multicellular organisms. We show that, as previously found for specialized interactions, generalized interactions can be evolutionarily conserved. Significant phylogenetic conservatism of interaction patterns was equally likely to occur in symbiotic and non-symbiotic interactions, as well as in mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Host-use differentiation among species was higher in phylogenetically conserved clades, irrespective of their generalization degree and taxonomic position within the tree of life. Our findings strongly suggest a shared pattern in the organization of biological systems through evolutionary time, mediated by marked conservatism of ecological interactions among taxa.},

We resolved an arctic, entire-season plant-flower visitor network into a temporal series of 1-day networks and compared the properties with its static equivalent based on data pooled over the entire season. Several properties differed. The nested link pattern in the static network was blurred in the dynamical version, because the characteristic long nestedness tail of flower-visitor specialists got stunted in the dynamical networks. This tail comprised a small food web of pollinators, parasitoids and hyper-parasitoids. The dynamical network had strong time delays in the transmission of direct and indirect effects among species. Twenty percent of all indirect links were impossible in the dynamical network. Consequently, properties and thus also robustness of ecological networks cannot be deduced from the static topology alone.},

abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 877-885 ABSTRACT: A major current challenge in evolutionary biology is to understand how networks of interacting species shape the coevolutionary process. We combined a model for trait evolution with data for twenty plant-animal assemblages to explore coevolution in mutualistic networks. The results revealed three fundamental aspects of coevolution in species-rich mutualisms. First, coevolution shapes species traits throughout mutualistic networks by speeding up the overall rate of evolution. Second, coevolution results in higher trait complementarity in interacting partners and trait convergence in species in the same trophic level. Third, convergence is higher in the presence of super-generalists, which are species that interact with multiple groups of species. We predict that worldwide shifts in the occurrence of super-generalists will alter how coevolution shapes webs of interacting species. Introduced species such as honeybees will favour trait convergence in invaded communities, whereas the loss of large frugivores will lead to increased trait dissimilarity in tropical ecosystems.},

abstract = {Although coevolution is widely recognized as an important evolutionary process for pairs of reciprocally specialized species, its importance within species-rich communities of generalized species has been questioned. Here we develop and analyze mathematical models of mutualistic communities, such as those between plants and pollinators or plants and seed-dispersers to evaluate the importance of coevolutionary selection within complex communities. Our analyses reveal that coevolutionary selection can drive significant changes in trait distributions with important consequences for the network structure of mutualistic communities. One such consequence is greater connectance caused by an almost invariable increase in the rate of mutualistic interaction within the community. Another important consequence is altered patterns of nestedness. Specifically, interactions mediated by a mechanism of phenotype matching tend to be antinested when coevolutionary selection is weak and even more strongly antinested as increasing coevolutionary selection favors the emergence of reciprocal specialization. In contrast, interactions mediated by a mechanism of phenotype differences tend to be nested when coevolutionary selection is weak, but less nested as increasing coevolutionary selection favors greater levels of generalization in both plants and animals. Taken together, our results show that coevolutionary selection can be an important force within mutualistic communities, driving changes in trait distributions, interaction rates, and even network structure.},

It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales. $\backslash$nSynthesis$\backslash$nAlthough species interactions are the backbone of ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and why) they vary through space and time.

We discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species interactions.},

abstract = {The high levels of species diversity observed within many biological communities are captivating, yet the mechanisms that may maintain such diversity remain elusive. Many of the phenotypic differences observed among species cause interspecific tradeoffs that ultimately act to maintain diversity through niche-based coexistence. In contrast, neutral community theory argues that phenotypic differences among species do not contribute to maintaining species diversity because species are ecologically equivalent. Here we provide experimental and observational field evidence that two phylogenetically very distant Enallagma species appear to be ecologically equivalent to one another. Experimental abundance manipulations showed that each species gains no demographic advantage at low relative abundance, whereas manipulations of total Enallagma abundance resulted in large increases in per capita mortality and large decreases in growth for both species. Moreover, demographic rates and relative abundances of multiple Enallagma species were uncorrelated with major environmental gradients in an observational study of 20 natural lakes. These are the expected patterns if species are ecologically equivalent. However, these results do not imply that all damselflies in these lakes are ecologically identical. Previous experimental results have demonstrated the operation of strong coexistence mechanisms maintaining Enallagma and its sister-genus Ischnura in these littoral food webs. Combined with a simple theoretical model we present, these results taken together show how both neutral and niche dynamics can jointly structure communities.},

To find them the food cymposition of this group was studied. The dissections demonstrated that of 9 species of Nematocera larvae Sphagnum was present in the food only of Psectrocladius ex gr. psilopterus, the quantity of Sphagnum being 0.16 of the food volume. The main food of non predating Nematocera larvae living in the submersed Sphagnum consists of the algae and the detritus. The emersed Sphagnum is also eaten but little. The springtails dominating here feed mainly on the fungi growing on the decomposing Sphagnum. Our data and the data by other authors gave a possibility to respresent the main food interrelations in the sphagnous bogs as shown in fig. 1.},

abstract = {Plant species vary greatly in defenses against herbivores, but existing theory has struggled to explain this variation. Here, we test how phylogenetic relatedness, tradeoffs, trait syndromes, and sexual reproduction affect the macroevolution of defense. To examine the macroevolution of defenses, we studied 26 Oenothera (Onagraceae) species, combining chemistry, comparative phylogenetics and experimental assays of resistance against generalist and specialist herbivores. We detected dozens of phenolic metabolites within leaves, including ellagitannins (ETs), flavonoids, and caffeic acid derivatives (CAs). The concentration and composition of phenolics exhibited low to moderate phylogenetic signal. There were clear negative correlations between multiple traits, supporting the prediction of allocation tradeoffs. There were also positively covarying suites of traits, but these suites did not strongly predict resistance to herbivores and thus did not act as defensive syndromes. By contrast, specific metabolites did correlate with the performance of generalist and specialist herbivores. Finally, that repeated losses of sex in Oenothera was associated with the evolution of increased flavonoid diversity and altered phenolic composition. These results show that secondary chemistry has evolved rapidly during the diversification of Oenothera. This evolution has been marked by allocation tradeoffs between traits, some of which are related to herbivore performance. The repeated loss of sex appears also to have constrained the evolution of plant secondary chemistry, which may help to explain variation in defense among plants.},

Harnessing this variability, we will show that it is useful to interpret empirically observed food webs as realisations of a family of stochastic processes, namely random dot-product graph models. These models provide an ideal extension of food-web models beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially probabilistic models. As an additional beneﬁt, our RDPG framework enables us to identify the pairwise distance structure given by species' functional food-web traits: this allows for the natural emergence of ecologically meaningful species groups. Lastly, our results suggest the notion that the evolutionary signature in food webs is already detectable in their stochastic backbones, while the contribution of their ﬁne wiring is arguable.},

abstract = {Annual phytoplankton productivity in Lake Constance is about 300 g C m−2, a value typical for mesoeutrophic lakes. Seasonal variations in phytoplankton biomass and productivity are exceptionally great because of a sequence of factors controlling the production process. During winter productivity is controlled by low energy inputs and high respiratory losses due to deep water column mixing. Biomass is low and water transparancy high. The spring phytoplankton growth is triggered by the thermal stabilization of the water column. The summer phytoplankton biomass maximum mainly depends on phosphorus availability. However, biomass yields comprise only 15–20{\%} of values to be expected from the Redfield ratio because large proportions of POM are detritus and non-algal biota. Moreover, sedimentation during the second half of the year removes biomass from the euphotic zone. Water transparency and thus vertical distribution of algal photosynthesis is highly dependent on phytoplankton biomass. Self-shading causes considerably smaller seasonal variations in areal biomass and photosynthetic rates than in volume-based values. By light-shade adaptation effects of seasonal fluctuations in mean daily surface radiance fluxes on algal photosynthesis can to a significant extent be compensated for. At any given level of biomass daylength is the major determinant of daily production rates.},

Consequently, identifying the factors that generate, maintain, and erode phenotypic and genetic variation in ecologically important traits within and among populations is important. Although persistent directional or stabilizing selection can deplete variation, spatial variation in conflicting directional selection can enhance variation. Here, we present evidence that phenotypic variation in limber pine ( Pinus flexilis) cone structure is enhanced by conflicting selection pressures exerted by its mutualistic seed disperser ( Clark's nutcracker Nucifraga columbiana) and an antagonistic seed predator ( pine squirrel Tamiasciurus spp.). Phenotypic variation in cone structure was bimodal and about two times greater where both agents of selection co-occurred than where one ( the seed predator) was absent. Within the region where both agents of selection co-occurred, bimodality in cone structure was pronounced where there appears to be a mosaic of habitats with some persistent habitats supporting only the seed disperser. These results indicate that conflicting selection stemming from spatial variation in community diversity can enhance phenotypic variation in ecologically important traits.},

abstract = {The ability of flower visitors to monitor returns when collecting pollen from flowers has been seldom studied despite the importance of pollen as a food resource, particularly for bees. Californian populations of Mimulus guttatus are polymorphic for pollen quality: many plants produce a high proportion of cytoplasmless pollen grains that render the grains incapable of fertilizing ovules or of supporting bees nutritionally. We found that different genotypes maintained a consistent proportion of inviable pollen within a genotype and over time. The number of pollen grains per flower was also consistent within a plant at each date but declined over time. We studied the ability of British bumble bees (Bombus spp.) to discriminate among plants of Mimulus guttatus on the basis of pollen quality and quantity at three scales: indoors with choices of two genotypes, in outdoor plots of several genotypes that varied in pollen quality, and outdoors at a whole-patch scale where two patches of plants differed in quality. We found that bees could discriminate among plants on the basis of pollen quality provided that flowers still retained most of the pollen. In the two-genotype trials, bees chose genotypes primarily on the quantity of viable pollen, and nectar was much less important. Similarly, where patches of low- and high-pollen quality plants were established, bees responded by visiting the high-quality patch more often and by visiting more flowers within the patch. However, the results from the outdoor plots that contained genotypes of varying phenotypes were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of a large number of separate plots showed that the overall correlation between visitation rate and pollen quality was significant, but variation among plots was also significant. A possible explanation for this inconsistency was suggested in a greenhouse trial in which we showed that, when foraging density was high, depletion of the standing crop of pollen happened quickly, and this reduced the ability of the foragers to choose the higher-quality genotypes. The results have implications for the evolution of pollen production in Mimulus guttatus and reward production in other plants.},

abstract = {A paradigm of evolutionary biology is that adaptation and reproductive isolation are caused by a nearly infinite number of mutations of individually small effect. Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating the genetic basis of pollinator discrimination in two closely related species of monkeyflowers that differ in their major pollinators. This system provides a unique opportunity to investigate the genetic architecture of adaptation and speciation because floral traits that confer pollinator specificity also contribute to premating reproductive isolation. We asked: (i) What floral traits cause pollinator discrimination among plant species? and (ii) What is the genetic basis of these traits? We examined these questions by using data obtained from a large-scale field experiment where genetic markers were employed to determine the genetic basis of pollinator visitation. Observations of F2 hybrids produced by crossing bee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii with hummingbird-pollinated Mimulus cardinalis revealed that bees preferred large flowers low in anthocyanin and carotenoid pigments, whereas hummingbirds favored nectar-rich flowers high in anthocyanins. An allele that increases petal carotenoid concentration reduced bee visitation by 80{\%}, whereas an allele that increases nectar production doubled hummingbird visitation. These results suggest that genes of large effect on pollinator preference have contributed to floral evolution and premating reproductive isolation in these monkeyflowers. This work contributes to growing evidence that adaptation and reproductive isolation may often involve major genes.},

abstract = {Particulate organic matter (POM), dissolved organic matter (DOM), bacteria and cladoceran were sampled seasonally at Zhihugang Estuary and Lake Center in Taihu Lake. The $\delta$13C of the four organic matter fractions showed consistent temporal variation, with heaviest values in summer and lower at other times of the year. The cladoceran $\delta$13C showed a significant correlation with that of POM, reflecting a heavy dietary dependence on POM during the study period. The bacteria became enriched in 13C compared with that of DOM throughout the sampling dates, although no significant relationship was found between the two fractions. $\delta$13C values of POM, cladoceran and bacteria were all negative significantly correlated with oxidation and reduction potential (ORP), and specific conductivity (SpCond). As for $\delta$15N, the seasonal pattern of food web components was variable. The POM $\delta$15N signature exhibited the most enriched isotope ratios during the summer months when dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) nutrients were at their lowest concentrations. The consumption of DIN in summer can explain in part the progressive accumulation of heavy nitrogen isotopes during this period. Spatially, $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N of the food web components were all slightly depleted at Estuary than that at Lake Center during the study period, possibly due to large allochthonous inputs at Zhihugang Estuary. Relatively wide ranges of stable isotopic values from both sites suggest that seasonality should be considered when attempting to establish food web structures in a eutrophic lake.},

Once O2 concentrations reached 1– 3 mg{\textperiodcentered}L–1, consumption slowed. No model that we fit captured O2 dynamics shortly after freezing. The best fit was a one-pool exponential decay model after one to four initial data were removed. Photosynthesis and freeze-out estimates suggest that O2 inputs are more important in shallow than in deep lakes. Oxygen decay rates (k) correlated with morphometry in shallow lakes and chlorophyll a, Secchi depth, and the sediment surface area to volume ratio in deep lakes. We hypothesize that the failure of chlorophyll a to correlate with k in shallow lakes is because macrophytes are the primary source of decaying organic matter but have not been included in assessments of winter O2 depletion. Thus, some processes in deep lakes cannot simply be scaled to smaller scales in shallow lakes.},

In contrast with the river continuum concept of Vannote et al.

Many common benthic invertebrates are ecologically flexible species with poorly synchronised life histories. These differences appear to be associated with the non-retentive, climatically unpredictable nature of the stream environment.

abstract = {Subsidies are donor-controlled inputs of nutrients and energy that can affect ecosystem-level processes in a recipient environment. Lake ecosystems receive large inputs of terrestrial carbon (C) in the form of dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM inputs may energetically subsidize heterotrophic bacteria and determine whether lakes function as sources or sinks of atmospheric CO(2). I experimentally tested this hypothesis using a series of mesocosm experiments in New England lakes. In the first experiment, I observed that CO(2) flux increased by 160{\%} 4 days following a 1,000 microM C addition in the form of DOM. However, this response was relatively short lived, as there was no effect of DOM enrichment on CO(2) flux beyond 8 days. In a second experiment, I demonstrated that peak CO(2) flux from mesocosms in two lakes increased linearly over a broad DOM gradient (slope for both lakes=0.02+/-0.001 mM CO(2).m(-2) day(-1) per microM DOC, mean+/-SE). Concomitant changes in bacterial productivity and dissolved oxygen strengthen the inference that increasing CO(2) flux resulted from the metabolism of DOM. I conducted two additional studies to test whether DOM-correlated attributes were responsible for the observed change in plankton metabolism along the subsidy gradient. First, terrestrial DOM reduced light transmittance, but experimental shading revealed that this was not responsible for the observed patterns of CO(2) flux. Second, organically bound nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) accompanied DOM inputs, but experimental nutrient additions (without organic C) caused mesocosms to be saturated with CO(2). Together, these results suggest that C content of terrestrial DOM may be an important subsidy for freshwater bacteria that can influence whether recipient aquatic ecosystems are sources or sinks of atmospheric CO(2).},

abstract = {Mutual trophic interactions between contiguous habitats have remained poorly understood despite their potential significance for community maintenance in ecological landscapes. In a deciduous forest and stream ecotone. aquatic insect emergence peaked around spring, when terrestrial invertebrate biomass was low. In contrast, terrestrial invertebrate input to the stream occurred primarily during summer, when aquatic invertebrate biomass was nearly at its lowest. Such reciprocal, across-habitat prey flux alternately subsidized both forest birds and stream fishes, accounting for 25.6{\%} and 44.0{\%} of the annual total energy budget of the bird and fish assemblages, respectively. Seasonal contrasts between allochthonous prey supply and in situ prey biomass determine the importance of reciprocal subsidies},

abstract = {Although plants are generally attacked by a community of several species of herbivores, relatively little is known about the strength of natural selection for resistance in multiple-herbivore communities-particularly how the strength of selection differs among herbivores that feed on different plant organs or how strongly genetic correlations in resistance affect the evolutionary responses of the plant. Here, we report on a field study measuring natural selection for resistance in a diverse community of herbivores of Solanum carolinense. Using linear phenotypic-selection analyses, we found that directional selection acted to increase resistance to seven species. Selection was strongest to increase resistance to fruit feeders, followed by flower feeders, then leaf feeders. Selection favored a decrease in resistance to a stem borer. Bootstrapping analyses showed that the plant population contained significant genetic variation for each of 14 measured resistance traits and significant covariances in one-third of the pairwise combinations of resistance traits. These genetic covariances reduced the plant's overall predicted evolutionary response for resistance against the herbivore community by about 60{\%}. Diffuse (co)evolution was widespread in this community, and the diffuse interactions had an overwhelmingly constraining (rather than facilitative) effect on the plant's evolution of resistance.},

abstract = {Floral evolution has often been associated with differences in pollina- tion syndromes. Recently, this conceptual structure has been criticized on the grounds that flowers attract a broader spectrum of visitors than one might expect based on their syndromes and that flowers often diverge without excluding one type of pollinator in favorof another. Despite these criticisms, we showthat pollination syndromes provide great utility in understanding the mechanisms of floral diversification. Our conclusions are based on the importance of organizing pollinators into functional groups according to presumed similarities in the selection pressures they exert. Furthermore, functional groups vary widely in their effectiveness as pollinators for particular plant species. Thus, although a plant may be visited by several functional groups, the relative se- lective pressures they exert will likely be very different.We discuss various methods of documenting selection on floral traits. Our review of the literature indicates over- whelming evidence that functional groups exert different selection pressures on floral traits.We also discuss the gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of pollination syndromes. In particular, we need more information about the relative importance of specific traits in pollination shifts, about what selective factors favor shifts between functional groups, about whether selection acts on traits inde- pendently or in combination, and about the role of history in pollination-syndrome evolution.},

We model plant competition in a spatially varying environment to show how shifting scales of dis- persal, competition, and environmental heterogeneity affect coexis- tence. Spatial coexistence mechanisms are partitioned into three types: the storage effect, nonlinear competitive variance, and growth- density covariance. We first describe how the strength of each of these mechanisms depends on covariances between population den- sities and between population densities and the environment, and we then explain how changes in the scales of dispersal, competition, and environmental heterogeneity should affect these covariances.Our quantitative approach allows us to show how changes in the scales of biological and physical processes can shift the relative importance of different classes of spatial coexistence mechanisms and gives us a more complete understanding of how environmental heterogeneity can enable coexistence. For example, we show how environmental heterogeneity can promote coexistence even when competing species have identical responses to the environment. Keywords:},

abstract = {Sympatric plant species with similar flowering phenologies and floral morphologies may compete for pollination, and as a consequence potentially influence each other's reproductive success and mating system. Two likely competitors are Mimulus ringens and Lobelia siphilitica, which co-occur in wet meadows of central and eastern North America, produce blue zygomorphic flowers, and share several species of bumble bee pollinators. To test for effects of competition for pollination, we planted experimental arrays of Mimulus ringens, each consisting of genets with unique combinations of homozygous marker genotypes. In two arrays we planted mixtures of Mimulus and Lobelia. and in two additional arrays we planted Mimulus without a competitor for pollination. Bumble bee pollinators frequently moved between Mimulus and Lobelia flowers in the mixed-species arrays, with 42{\%} of plant-to-plant movements being interspecific transitions. Pollinator movements between species were associated with a reduction in the amount of conspecific pollen arriving on Mimulus stigmas. The presence of Lobelia led to a significant 37{\%} reduction in the mean number of Mimulus seeds per fruit. In addition, Mimulus had a significantly lower rate of outcrossing in the mixed-species arrays (0.43) than in the "pure" arrays (0.63). This is the first study to demonstrate that competition for pollination directly influences outcrossing rates. Our work suggests that in self-compatible populations with genetic load, competition for pollination may not only reduce seed quantity, but may also lower seed quality.},

abstract = {Background and Aims ‘Pollination syndromes' are suites of phenotypic traits hypothesized to reflect convergent adaptations of flowers for pollination by specific types of animals. They were first developed in the 1870s and honed during the mid 20th Century. In spite of this long history and their central role in organizing research on plant–pollinator interactions, the pollination syndromes have rarely been subjected to test. The syndromes were tested here by asking whether they successfully capture patterns of covariance of floral traits and predict the most common pollinators of flowers.Methods Flowers in six communities from three continents were scored for expression of floral traits used in published descriptions of the pollination syndromes, and simultaneously the pollinators of as many species as possible were characterized.Key Results Ordination of flowers in a multivariate ‘phenotype space' defined by the syndromes showed that almost no plant species fall within the discrete syndrome clusters. Furthermore, in approximately two-thirds of plant species, the most common pollinator could not be successfully predicted by assuming that each plant species belongs to the syndrome closest to it in phenotype space.Conclusions The pollination syndrome hypothesis as usually articulated does not successfully describe the diversity of floral phenotypes or predict the pollinators of most plant species. Caution is suggested when using pollination syndromes for organizing floral diversity, or for inferring agents of floral adaptation. A fresh look at how traits of flowers and pollinators relate to visitation and pollen transfer is recommended, in order to determine whether axes can be identified that describe floral functional diversity more successfully than the traditional syndromes.},

abstract = {Contemporary animal–plant interactions such as herbivory are widely understood to be shaped by evolutionary history. Yet questions remain about the role of plant phylogenetic diversity in generating and maintaining herbivore diversity, and whether evolutionary relatedness of producers might predict the composition of consumer communities. We tested for evidence of evolutionary associations among arthropods and the plants on which they were found, using phylogenetic analysis of naturally occurring arthropod assemblages sampled from a plant-diversity manipulation experiment. Considering phylogenetic relationships among more than 900 arthropod consumer taxa and 29 plant species in the experiment, we addressed several interrelated questions. First, our results support the hypothesis that arthropod functional traits such as body size and trophic role are phylogenetically conserved in community ecological samples. Second, herbivores tended to co- occur with closer phylogenetic relatives than would be expected at random, whereas predators and parasitoids did not show phylogenetic association patterns. Consumer specialization, as measured by association through time with monocultures of particular host plant species, showed significant phylogenetic signal, although the strength of this association varied among plant species. Polycultures of phylogenetically dissimilar plant species supported more phylogenetically dissimilar consumer communities than did phylogenetically similar poly- cultures. Finally, we separated the effects of plant species richness and relatedness in predicting the phylogenetic distribution of the arthropod assemblages in this experiment. The phylogenetic diversity of plant communities predicted the phylogenetic diversity of herbivore communities even after accounting for plant species richness. The phylogenetic diversity of secondary consumers differed by guild, with predator phylogenetic diversity responding to herbivore relatedness, while parasitoid phylogenetic diversity was driven by plant relatedness. Evolutionary associations between plants and their consumers are apparent in plots only meters apart in a single field, indicating a strong role for host-plant phylogenetic diversity in sustaining landscape consumer biodiversity.},

abstract = {Despite a long history of the study of tropical forests, uncertainty about the importance of different ecological processes in shaping tropical tree species distributions persists. Trait- and phylogenetic-based tests of community assembly provide a powerful way to detect community assembly processes but have seldom been applied to the same community. Both methods are well suited to testing how the relative importance of different ecological processes changes with spatial scale. Here we apply both methods to the Yasuni Forest Dynamics Plot, a 25-ha Amazonian forest with {\textgreater}1100 tree species. We found evidence for habitat filtering from both trait and phylogenetic methods from small (25 m(2)) to intermediate (10 000 m(2)) spatial scales. Trait- based methods detected even spacing of strategies, a pattern consistent with niche partitioning or enemy-mediated density dependence, at smaller spatial scales (25-400 m(2)). Simulation modeling of community assembly processes suggests that low statistical power to detect even spacing of traits at larger spatial scales may contribute to the observed patterns. Trait and phylogenetic methods tended to identify the same areas of the forest as being subject to habitat filtering. Phylogenetic community tests, which are far less data-intensive than trait-based methods, captured much of the same. ltering patterns detected by trait-based methods but often failed to detect even-spacing patterns apparent in trait data. Taken together, it appears that both habitat associations and niche differentiation shape species co-occurrence patterns in one of the most diverse forests in the world at a range of small and intermediate spatial scales.},

However, this previous work has focused on either antagonistic (i.e., predator-prey) or mutualistic networks and has used different methodologies. Thus, a comparative assessment of both the frequency and the strength of phylogenetic signal across network types and components of network structure has been precluded. Here, we address this issue using a data set comprising 60 antagonistic and mutualistic networks. By quantifying simultaneously the matching and centrality components of network architecture-capturing the modular and nested structure, respectively-we test the presence and quantify the strength of phylogenetic signal across network types, species sets, and components of network structure. We find contrasting differences across such groups. First, phylogenetic signal is stronger in antagonistic webs than in mutualistic webs. Second, resources are more strongly constrained than consumers in food webs, while animals show more constraints than plants in mutualistic networks. Third, phylogenetic constraints are stronger for the matching component than for the centrality component of network structure. These results can shed light on the contrasting evolutionary constraints shaping network structure across interaction types and species sets.},

abstract = {Apoptotic cells release 'find-me' signals at the earliest stages of death to recruit phagocytes. The nucleotides ATP and UTP represent one class of find-me signals, but their mechanism of release is not known. Here, we identify the plasma membrane channel pannexin 1 (PANX1) as a mediator of find-me signal/nucleotide release from apoptotic cells. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated knockdown of PANX1 led to decreased nucleotide release and monocyte recruitment by apoptotic cells. Conversely, PANX1 overexpression enhanced nucleotide release from apoptotic cells and phagocyte recruitment. Patch-clamp recordings showed that PANX1 was basally inactive, and that induction of PANX1 currents occurred only during apoptosis. Mechanistically, PANX1 itself was a target of effector caspases (caspases 3 and 7), and a specific caspase-cleavage site within PANX1 was essential for PANX1 function during apoptosis. Expression of truncated PANX1 (at the putative caspase cleavage site) resulted in a constitutively open channel. PANX1 was also important for the 'selective' plasma membrane permeability of early apoptotic cells to specific dyes. Collectively, these data identify PANX1 as a plasma membrane channel mediating the regulated release of find-me signals and selective plasma membrane permeability during apoptosis, and a new mechanism of PANX1 activation by caspases.},

abstract = {Plant-animal mutualistic networks are interaction webs consisting of two sets of entities, plant and animal species, whose evolutionary dynamics are deeply influenced by the outcomes of the interactions, yielding a diverse array of coevolutionary processes. These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant-pollinator and 24 plant-frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant-animal mutualistic networks (65.6{\%}) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2{\%}) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant-animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.},

Little is known, however, about which ecological and evolutionary processes generate these network patterns(3,9). Here we use phylogenetic methods(10,11) to show that the phylogenetic relationships of species predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. As a consequence of the phylogenetic effects on interaction patterns, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree(12,13) and a more pronounced loss of taxonomic diversity than expected in the absence of a phylogenetic signal. Our results emphasize how the simultaneous consideration of phylogenetic information and network architecture can contribute to our understanding of the structure and fate of species-rich communities.},

abstract = {Recent studies have started to unravel the structure of mutualistic networks, although few functional explanations underlying such structure have been explored. We used computer simulations to test whether complementarity between phenotypic traits of plants and animals can explain the pervasive tendency of specialists to interact with proper subsets of species that generalists interact with (nested interactions), and how phylogeny affects such interaction patterns. Simultaneously, we assessed whether complementarity and phylogenetic structure were associated with patterns of interaction in a real mutualistic community. Simulation results support that highly nested networks can emerge from phenotypic complementarity, particularly when several traits are involved. The hierarchical structure of phylogenetic relations can also contribute to increased nestedness because traits determining complementarity are then inherited in a correlated fashion. Phylogenetic effects on resulting generalization levels are often low, but can be detected. Results from the empirical network support a relevant role of complementarity and phylogenetic history on interaction patterns. Our results demonstrate that these factors can contribute to nestedness, which emphasize the necessity of considering evolutionary mechanisms in studies of community structure.},

Here, we introduce a mathematical framework based on the concept of structural stability to explain such a disparity of results.We investigated the range of conditions necessary for the stable coexistence of all species in mutualistic systems.We show that the apparently contradictory conclusions reached by previous studies arise as a consequence of overseeing either the necessary conditions for persistence or its dependence onmodel parameterization.We show that observed network architectures maximize the range of conditions for species coexistence.We discuss the applicability of structural stability to study other types of interspecific interactions.},

@book{Elton1927,
abstract = {Charles Elton was one of the founders of ecology, and hisAnimal Ecologywas one of the seminal works that defined the field. In this book Elton introduced and drew together many principles still central to ecology today, including succession, niche, food webs, and the links between communities and ecosystems, each of which he illustrated with well-chosen examples. Many of Elton's ideas have proven remarkably prescientfor instance, his emphasis on the role climatic changes play in population fluctuations anticipated recent research in this area stimulated by concerns about global warming.For Chicago's reprint of this classic work, ecologists Mathew A. Leibold and J. Timothy Wootton have provided new introductions to each chapter, placing Elton's ideas in historical and scientific context. They trace modern developments in each of the key themes Elton introduced, and provide references to the most current literature. The result will be an important work for ecologists interested in the roots of their discipline, for educated readers looking for a good overview of the field, and for historians of science.},

abstract = {The alteration of landscapes by human activities worldwide has forced many animal species to persist in remnants of natural habitats. One of the best examples of this process occurs in central-east Argentina, where the original prairies were almost completely replaced by agricultural land, cattle production areas and increasing urbanization. We used nine microsatellite loci to analyze the population genetic structure of the Sigmodontine rodent Calomys musculinus in two anthropically altered habitats: an agroecosystem and a city. Rodents inhabiting urban vacant lots showed higher levels of relatedness and genetic differentiation than rodents inhabiting the agroecosystem. Urban rodents presented a pattern of isolation by distance; in the rural habitat this pattern was present only along the border of a secondary road, but not over the entire area surveyed. In the city, a spatially limited but buffered environment, populations would be small, demographically stable, and dispersal would be restricted. On the contrary, in agroecosystems populations would experience a high rate of turn over: local demes would originate each year by a mixture of overwintering individuals, and dispersal would occur preferentially along the weedy borders of fields. ?? 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft f??r S??ugetierkunde.},

abstract = {The Northern California Current (NCC) is a seasonally productive and open ecosystem. It is home to both a diverse endemic community and to seasonally transient species. Productivity and food web structure vary seasonally, interannually, and decadally due to variability in coastal upwelling, climate-scale physical processes, and the migratory species entering the system. The composition of the pelagic community varies between years, including changes to mid-trophic level groups that represent alternate energy-transfer pathways between lower and upper trophic levels (forage fishes, euphausiids, jellyfish). Multiple data sets, including annual spring and summer mesoscale surveys of the zooplankton, pelagic fish, and seabird communities, were used to infer NCC trophic network arrangements and develop end-to-end models for each of the 2003-2007 upwelling seasons. Each model was used to quantify the interannual variability in energy-transfer efficiency from bottom to top trophic levels. When each model was driven under an identical nutrient input rate, substantial differences in the energy available to each functional group were evident. Scenario analyses were used to examine the roles of forage fishes, euphausiids, and jellyfish (small gelatinous zooplankton and large carnivorous jellyfish) as alternate energy transfer pathways. Euphausiids were the more important energy transfer pathway; a large proportion of the lower trophic production consumed was transferred to higher trophic levels. In contrast, jellyfish acted as a production loss pathway; little of the production consumed was passed upwards. Analysis of the range of ecosystem states observed interannually and understanding system sensitivity to variability among key trophic groups improves our ability to predict NCC ecosystem response to short- and long-term environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Spatial coexistence depends on a variety of biological and physical processes, and the relative scales of these processes may promote or suppress coexistence. We model plant competition in a spatially varying environment to show how shifting scales of dis- persal, competition, and environmental heterogeneity affect coexis- tence. Spatial coexistence mechanisms are partitioned into three types: the storage effect, nonlinear competitive variance, and growth- density covariance. We first describe how the strength of each of these mechanisms depends on covariances between population den- sities and between population densities and the environment, and we then explain how changes in the scales of dispersal, competition, and environmental heterogeneity should affect these covariances.Our quantitative approach allows us to show how changes in the scales of biological and physical processes can shift the relative importance of different classes of spatial coexistence mechanisms and gives us a more complete understanding of how environmental heterogeneity can enable coexistence. For example, we show how environmental heterogeneity can promote coexistence even when competing species have identical responses to the environment. Keywords:},

abstract = {The properties of food webs are examined to assess whether the correct properties are being modelled. The linkage arrangements and the extent of their variability and responses to local environmental change are examined using two webs from observations at Cape Flattery, Washington State and Torch Bay, Alaska. It is concluded that enumerating links through direct observations provides little information on a particular species' importance and the connecting component of food webs is susceptible to enormous geographic and within habitat variations. What counts is the competitive stature of the preferred prey, implying that cross-links will be as important as trophic ones. The evidence for strong interactions and some of their consequences as a unit are discussed. Basic data are given on 3 experiments in the marine environment that reveal the difficulty of examining weak interactions. The author concludes that trophic links are unequal in strength, and most benthic and aquatic communities seem to be characterized by high variance in this measure. Strong links ar easily demonstrated experimentally and their presence readily explains the cascading changes that characterize certain altered ecosystems. Further, predictable strong linkage can generate trophically different but persistent alternative resource bases. These later appear not to develop when the strong interaction is unpredictable in space or time. Finally, predictable strong interactions can encourage the development of modules or subsystems embedded within the community nexus. The individuals comprising these may be co-adapted to one another and exhibit sophisticated mutualisms.},

The web includes organisms from all regions of the pond (i.e., littoral, limnetic, profundal, and benthic zones) as well as terrestrial organisms that interact with the aquatic community or have aquatic life-stages. The food web has three attributes that are often omitted from freshwater food webs: inclusion of (1) parasites and other infectious agents, (2) ontogenetic stages of most animals with complex life cycles, and (3) biomass information for many animals. Data on species presence was obtained over three years using field sampling techniques (i.e., seine- and D-nets, stove-pipe samplers, and visual encounter surveys) and laboratory examinations of free-living organisms for infectious agents (primarily metazoan parasites, but also some microbes). We collected body size and biomass data for abundant aquatic animals.1mm and for trematode parasites, which were the most abundant parasitic group. Information on trophic interactions was obtained from direct observations and published literature sources. Within the food-web data we include supporting information for each node on taxonomy, lifestyle, and residency; and for each link we include information on type of interaction and the source of evidence (e.g., direct observation, literature, or inferred). The food web contains 113 nodes, 1905 links, and 63 species. To facilitate comparisons between food webs from different ecosystems we present the data in a system- neutral format.},

Carcass (A) was placed just inside a small shrubbery with no undergrowth and amongst partly rotted leaves. This habitat was generally dry and in deep shade. (B) was placed on cinders in loose sward under a large plane tree j this habitat was more subject to early morning dew than (A) and was exposed to light. (C) was situated in thick grass near the open verge of a meadow. Each carcass was covered with wire-netting pegged down at the comers to prevent disturbance by foxes and dogs. During examination this netting was removed and the carcass in each case was disturbed. Daily observations were made between 0800 and 0830 h G.M.T., 5-18 July inclusive. In many cases it was necessary to collect specimens for identification. In only a few instances did specimens escape unrecorded, and these represent only a fraction of the fauna present on examination. Not all specimens seen or caught have been fully identified, but specific determinations have been undertaken where possible. Grateful acknowledgement is made to the members of the staff of the Brit.

abstract = {Replicate mass-balanced solutions to Ecopath models describing carbon-based trophic structures and flows were developed for the Lake Ontario offshore food web before and after invasion-induced disruption. The food webs link two pathways of energy and matter flow: the grazing chain (phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish) and the microbial loop (bacteria-protozoans) and include 19 species-groups and three detrital groups. Mass-balance was achieved by using constrained optimization techniques to randomly vary initial estimates of biomass and diet composition. After the invasion, production declined for all trophic levels and species-groups except Chinook salmon. The trophic level (TL) increased for smelt, adult sculpin, adult alewife and Chinook salmon. Changes to ecotrophic efficiencies indicate a reduction in phytoplankton grazing, increased predation pressure on Mysis, adult smelt and alewife and decreased predation pressure on protozoans. Specific resource to consumer TTE changed; increasing for protozoans (8.0-11.5{\%}), Mysis (0.6-1.0{\%}), and Chinook salmon (1.0-2.3{\%}) and other salmonines (0.4-0.5{\%}) and decreasing for zooplankton (20.2-15.1{\%}), prey-fish (9.7-8.8{\%}), and benthos (1.7-0.6{\%}). Direct trophic influences of recent invasive species were low. The synchrony of the decline in PP and species-group production indicates strong bottom-up influence. Mass balance required an increase of two to threefold in lower trophic level biomass and production, confirming a previously observed paradoxical deficit in lower trophic level production. Analysis of food web changes suggest hypotheses that may apply to other similar large pelagic systems including, (1) as pelagic primary productivity declines, overgrazing of zooplankton results in an increase in protozoan production and a loss of trophic transfer efficiency, (2) habitat and food web changes increased Mysis predation on Diporeia and contributed to their recent decline, and (3) production of Chinook salmon, the primary piscivore, was uncoupled from pelagic production processes. This study demonstrates the value of food web models to better understand the impact of invasive species and to develop novel hypotheses concerning trophic influences. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Huizache-Caimanero coastal lagoon complex on the Pacific coast of Mexico supports an important shrimp fishery and is one of the most productive systems in catch per unit area of this resource. Four other less important fish groups are also exploited. In this study, we integrated the available information of the system into a mass-balance trophic model to describe the ecosystem structure and flows of energy using the Ecopath approach. The model includes 26 functional groups consisting of 15 fish groups, seven invertebrate groups, macrophytes, phytoplankton, and a detritus group. The resulting model was consistent as indicated by the output parameters. According to the overall pedigree index (0.75), which measures the quality of the input data on a scale from 0 to 1, it is a high quality model. Results indicate that zooplankton, microcrustaceans, and polychaetes are the principal link between trophic level (TL) one (primary producers and detritus) and consumers of higher TLs. Most production from macrophytes flows to detritus, and phytoplankton production is incorporated into the food web by zooplankton. Half of the flow from TL one to the next level come from detritus, which is an important energy source not only for several groups in the ecosystem but also for fisheries, as shown by mixed trophic impacts. The Huizache-Caimanero complex has the typical structure of tropical coastal lagoons and estuaries. The TL of consumers ranges from 2.0 to 3.6 because most groups are composed of juveniles, which use the lagoons as a nursery or protection area. Most energy flows were found in the lower part of the trophic web. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The continental shelf of the Ross Sea is one of the Antarctic's most intensively studied regions. We review the available data on the region's physical characteristics (currents and ice concentrations) and their spatial variations, as well as components of the neritic food web, including lower and middle levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton, krill, fishes), the upper trophic levels (seals, penguins, pelagic birds, whales) and benthic fauna. A hypothetical food web is presented. Biotic interactions, such as the role of Euphausia crystallorophias and Pleuragramma antarcticum as grazers of lower levels and food for higher trophic levels, are suggested as being critical. The neritic food web contrasts dramatically with others in the Antarctic that appear to be structured around the keystone species Euphausia superba. Similarly, we suggest that benthic-pelagic coupling is stronger in the Ross Sea than in most other Antarctic regions. We also highlight many of the unknowns within the food web, and discuss the impacts of a changing Ross Sea habitat on the ecosystem.},

abstract = {Belowground processes are essential for the overall carbon and nitrogen fluxes in forests. Neither the functioning of the soil food web mediating these fluxes, nor its modulation by environmental factors is sufficiently understood. In this study the belowground carbon and nitrogen mineralisation of four European coniferous forest sites (northern Sweden to north-east France) with different climate and N depositional inputs was analysed by investigating the soil food webs using field observations and modelling. The soil fauna directly contributed 7-13{\%} to C mineralisation, among which the testate amoebae (Protozoa) made the largest contribution. Microbial grazing was suggested to have an important indirect effect by stimulating bacterial turnover. Due to relatively high C:N ratios of their substrate, bacteria immobilized N, while the fauna i.e. testate amoebae, nematodes, microarthropods and enchytraeids. counteracted this N immobilisation. Despite similar food web biomass, the sites differed with respect to food web structure and C and N flows. Model calculations suggested a significant influence of food web structure on soil ecosystem processes in addition to environmental factors and resource quality. Mineralisation rates were lowest at the low N input boreal site with a food web dominated by fungal pathways. Further south, as N availability increased. bacterial pathways became more important and the cycling of C and N was faster. The bioavailability of degradable C sources is suggested to be a limiting factor for microbial activity and overall mineralisation rates. In this respect, above- and belowground interactions e.g. transfers of labile C sources from the vegetation to the decomposer system deserve further attention. Our study revealed the combined effects of climate and nutrient inputs to ecosystems and the subsequent changes in the structure and functioning of the systems. If decomposition, and therefore carbon loss, is stimulated as a consequence of structural and/or nutritional changes, resulting for example from continuous industrial N emission, the storage capacity of forest ecosystems Could be altered.},

abstract = {The sprawling patterns of land development common to metropolitan areas of the US have been blamed for high levels of automobile travel, and thus for air quality problems. In response, smart growth programs - designed to counter sprawl - have gained popularity in the US. Studies show that, all else equal, residents of neighborhoods with higher levels of density, land-use mix, transit accessibility, and pedestrian friendliness drive less than residents of neighborhoods with lower levels of these characteristics. These studies have shed little light, however, on the underlying direction of causality - in particular, whether neighborhood design influences travel behavior or whether travel preferences influence the choice of neighborhood. The evidence thus leaves a key question largely unanswered: if cities use land use policies to bring residents closer to destinations and provide viable alternatives to driving, will people drive less and thereby reduce emissions? Here a quasi-longitudinal design is used to investigate the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and travel behavior while taking into account the role of travel preferences and neighborhood preferences in explaining this relationship. A multivariate analysis of cross-sectional data shows that differences in travel behavior between suburban and traditional neighborhoods are largely explained by attitudes. However, a quasi-longitudinal analysis of changes in travel behavior and changes in the built environment shows significant associations, even when attitudes have been accounted for, providing support for a causal relationship. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. We studied the effect of substratum movement on the communities of adjacent mountain and spring tributaries of the Ivishak River in arctic Alaska (69 degrees 1'N, 147 degrees 43'W). We expected the mountain stream to have significant bed movement during summer because of storm flows and the spring stream to have negligible bed movement because of constant discharge. 2. We predicted that the mountain stream would be inhabited only by taxa able to cope with frequent bed movement. Therefore, we anticipated that the mountain stream would have lower macroinvertebrate species richness and biomass and a food web with fewer trophic levels and lower connectance than the spring stream. 3. Substrata marked in situ indicated that 57-66{\%} of the bed moved during summer in the mountain stream and 4-20{\%} moved in the spring stream. 4. Macroinvertebrate taxon richness was greater in the spring (25 taxa) than in the mountain stream (20 taxa). Mean macroinvertebrate biomass was also greater in the spring (4617 mg dry mass m(-2)) than in the mountain stream (635 mg dry mass m(-2)). Predators contributed 25{\%} to this biomass in the spring stream, but only 7{\%} in the mountain stream. 5. Bryophyte biomass was {\textgreater} 1000 times greater in the spring stream (88.4 g ash-free dry mass m(-2)) than the mountain stream (0.08 g ash-free dry mass m(-2)). We attributed this to differences in substratum stability between streams. The difference in extent of bryophyte cover between streams probably explains the high macroinvertebrate biomass in the spring stream. 6. Mean food-web connectance was similar between streams, ranging from 0.18 in the spring stream to 0.20 in the mountain stream. Mean food chain length was 3.04 in the spring stream and 1.83 in the mountain stream. Dolly Varden char (Salvelinus malma) was the top predator in the mountain stream and the American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus) was the top predator in the spring stream. The difference in mean food chain length between streams was due largely to the presence of C. mexicanus at the spring stream. 7. Structural differences between the food webs of the spring and mountain streams were relatively minor. The difference in the proportion of macroinvertebrate biomass contributing to different trophic levels was major, however, indicating significant differences in the volume of material and energy flow between food-web nodes (i.e. food web function).},

System primary production is 153.7 g C m–2 yr–1 and invertebrate production 53.3 g C m–2 yr–1. Invertebrate consumption amounts to 702.6 g C m–2 yr–1.

System consumption is highest on the import from the upstream lake with 532.5 g C m–2 yr–1, sediment detritus with 135.5 g C m–2 yr–1, and primary producers with 25.7 g C m–2 yr–1. The lowest predation pressure is observed for Bivalvia with an ecotrophic efficiency of {\textless}10{\%} and highest for Chironomidae with 91{\%}.

abstract = {Relative to Nepenthes species in West Malaysia near the evolutionary centre of the genus, outlying species of Nepenthes in the Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Madagascar have fewer species of both prey and predator living in them, fewer and smaller guilds of species, much apparently empty niche space, less complex food webs, and a greater connectance. Differences between the food webs appear to be related in a complex way to the size of the country and its degree of spatial and temporal isolation, the size of the local species pool capable of colonizing the pitchers, and the number of Nepenthes species present. The data may illustrate how food webs change to become more complex, both by the addition of new guilds of species and the addition of species to existing guilds, while at the same time certain properties of the food web are kept approximately constant.},

abstract = {We studied the planktonic community established in Lake Ciso (Girona, Spain) during summer stratification, with the aim of describing the food web of a system as completely as possible. The lake was sampled 19 times during 1990 and 1991. We first determined which populations contributed significantly to total summer biomass. Then, we determined the trophic role of these populations by several independent approaches, and aggregated the community into functional groups. The binary food web obtained indicated that Me structure of Me food web in Lake Ciso was similar to that found in other systems. Finally, we quantified Me trophic fluxes among populations using a simple algorithm which considers the vertical distribution of organisms and the functional responses of the different predators. The trophic food web obtained revealed 2 interesting properties. First, the compartments with larger biomass were relatively stable during stratification and presented slow growth and low predatory losses. Second, there was a very inefficient transfer of organic matter from the lower levels (bacteria, algae and protozoans) to the higher levels (rotifers and zooplankton) of the food web. Both properties could be explained by the fact that most biomass of the system accumulated in the metalimnion, along opposite gradients of oxygen and sulfide, which determined an environment with reduced competition and predation. We postulate that metalimnetic communities above anaerobic hypolimnia can be regarded as sinks of organic matter off the epilimnion.},

abstract = {Work currently being carried out on the Ythan estuary by members of staff, research students and undergraduates of the Zoology Department, University of Aberdeen, is part of a long-term programme planned in 1964. The aim is to quantify the seasonably variable exploitation of the invertebrate fauna of the estuary by the wide variety of predators present, mainly birds and fish. In the past seven years, three staff members, ten Ph.D. students and about ten undergraduates have participated actively in research projects. Some of the results have already been published but many data are still in unpublished theses. This paper is the first attempted synthesis of the work. Whereas we are primarily concerned here with the interrelations between populations of animals within the estuary, this particular estuarine ecosystem also offered the opportunity to make detailed population studies per se, in a relatively natural situation.  Our studies have been deliberately confined to the upper trophic levels of the ecosystem; we believe that a useful contribution can be made to the understanding of estuarine food chains, and to predatorprey interrelations in particular, without becoming involved, initially at least, in studies of the food and feeding of the prey. Bird predators are easily observed and quantitative data on their numbers, distribution, feeding behaviour, feeding rates, and diet can readily be obtained, but the fish species are much more difficult to study in this context, and we have to rely on various catching methods to provide much of the data. The invertebrate prey species are readily accessible, in intertidal areas exposed at low tide, allowing studies of distribution, dispersion pattern, standing crop numbers and biomass, and productivity to be made.  The project is recognised as part of the UK's supporting programme to the International Biological Programme (PM Section).},

abstract = {The Gulf of Cadiz (North-eastern Atlantic, Spain) is an exploited ecosystem characterized by high marine biodiversity and productivity. Over the last decade, the landings of fish stocks such as anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and hake (Merluccius merluccius) have been declining and currently remain low. A food-web model of the Gulf of Cadiz has been developed by means of a mass balance approach using the software EwE 6 to provide a snapshot of the ecosystem in 2009. The goals of this study were to: (1) characterize the food-web structure and functioning, (2) identify the main keystone groups of the ecosystem, (3) assess the impact of fishing to the Gulf of Cadiz compared to that in other essential marine ecosystems in the coastal area of Spain: Cantabrian Sea (North-eastern Atlantic) and Southern Catalan Sea (Mediterranean Sea), and (4) examine the limitations and weaknesses of the Gulf of Cadiz model for improvements and future research directions. The model consists of 43 functional groups, including the main trophic components of the system with emphasis target and non-target fish species. The main trophic flows are determined by the interaction between detritus, phytoplankton and micro- and mesozooplankton. Rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), cephalopods and dolphins present important overall effects as keystone species on the rest of the groups. The exploitation of fisheries composed mainly of trawlers, purse seiners and artisanal boats is intensive in the Gulf of Cadiz with all fleets exerting high impacts on most living groups of the ecosystem. The findings highlighted that the Gulf of Cadiz is a notably stressed ecosystem, displaying characteristics of a heavily exploited area. The comparative approach highlights that the three ecosystems display similarities with regard to structure and functioning such as the dominance of the pelagic fraction, a strong benthic-pelagic coupling, the important role of detritus, and the high impact of fishery exploitation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This multivariate statistical analysis is designed to isolate the effect of size from other variables that influence the underlying cost structure of municipal solid waste incinerators. Hence, the regression models for both construction and operating costs investigate several inherent factors, including design capacity, material and/or energy recovery, air pollution control, ownership, as well as actual and expected operating hours for different technologies. Several econometric model structures are evaluated systemmatically to find the most appropriate functional form for both construction costs and operating costs. The tested functional forms cover multiplicative single equation models, multiplicative recursive equation systems, just or over identified simultaneous systems, nonlinear seeming unrelated regression (SUR) systems. IML and ETS subroutines in SAS package have been applied for solving these models. Nonlinear SUR is selected as the representative model in this paper. The major estimation issues examined are heteroscedasticity, collinearity and the influence of outliers. But the scale economy, cost elasticity, and the interaction between construction and operating costs are also of significance economically. Based on nearly 150 observations, normalizations for different geographic regions and time are conducted and facilities are classified as mass burn waterwall, modular, refuse-derived-fuel (RDF), refractory incinerators and rotary combustors. The results show that it is important to model individual technologies separately to avoid exaggerating the importance of scale economy by overall observations.},

abstract = {1. A method for finding the consequences of long-term generalized press perturbations in multispecies ecological communities, with relatively modest requirements for data, is explicated. The approach uses energetic and allometric reasoning to set some parameter values for which data are not available. The remaining unknown parameters are treated as random variables, enabling the calculation of probability distributions for the outcomes that are of interest. 2. The method is used to investigate the effect of a cull of fur seals on fisheries in the Benguela ecosystem, using a 29-species foodweb for that system. In the case of Cape fur seals treated here, it is found that a cull of seals is more likely to be detrimental to total yields from all exploited species than it is to be beneficial. 3. The influence of weak links on the effects of a cull is investigated. Using both consumption by each species and consumption of each species to define link strength, a clear threshold in link strength is found, indicating that 44{\%} of all links could be deleted from the foodweb without affecting the predictions significantly. Even using a criterion based on consumption by each species alone (conventional dietary proportion data), about the same number of links can be deleted without seriously affecting the predictions of the model. This is a very helpful (and encouraging) result for the design of an observational protocol for systematic efforts to gather data for multispecies modelling.},

abstract = {Probably in early 1967 a piscivore from South America Cichla ocellaris was introduced to Gatun Lake in the Panama Canal Zone. As this predator population spread through the lake the initial effect was dramatic reductions in almost all secondary consumers. These spp reductions produced in turn second-and third-order changes at other trophic levels of the ecosystem. The resulting changes in the lake community can be seen best by examining the general Gatun Lake food web. The decrease in numbers of the important planktivore Melaniris has resulted in changes within the zooplankton community as illustrated by the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia. The tertiary-consumer populations such as tarpon, black terns, kingfishers and herons formerly dependent on small fishes for food appear less frequently in the Cichla areas of the lake. There has also been possibly a resurgence of the local mosquito populations (which are malaria vectors) caused by the reduction in the populations of insect eating fishes. Even the primary producers may be affected by this introduction. Although at present the Gatun Lake ecosystem is undergoing rapid changes we anticipate an eventual return to some form of equilibrium. However it will be some time before we can evaluate the permanence or transience of the many changes produced in the trophic levels by the introduction of a single top-level predator to this lake system.},

abstract = {The principal trophic levels, each subdivided into groups of organismic elements, are distinguished in the planktonic communities of the Eastern Equatorial and the Peruvian upwellings. Production intensity or metabolism have been determined experimentally for all elements. A scheme is suggested for computing production from data on metabolism for all the elements of a community, as well as for computing net and real production and other functional characteristics for definite trophic levels and the community as a whole. Based on the quantitative estimation of the efficiency of primary production and other functional characteristics, the development of communities is divided into production and destruction periods; they are, in turn, subdivided into steps associated with a certain degree of water trophicity. The balance of net production of the communities in the Peruvian upwelling indicates that the excess production of a community above the shelf is utilized completely in the narrow (1OO to 150 sea miles) band of off-shore water. This paper describes an attempt to trace the changes taking place in the functional characteristics of plankton communities and to compare them with the changes observed in the communities of the Peruvian and East-Equatorial upwellings.},

abstract = {An Ecopath model was constructed to describe the ecosystem of Lake Qiandaohu, a stock-enhanced large deep Chinese reservoir with silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) dominated in its pelagic community. The food web structure and ecosystem property of the reservoir were analyzed and evaluated. The results showed that there were seven trophic levels (TLs) in the system, with the trophic flows primarily occurring through the first four TLs. The food web structure of this ecosystem was characterized with a bulged intermediate trophic level, which was contrary to the wasp-waist food web structure occurred in most natural aquatic ecosystems. The corresponding trophic flow pattern showing by transfer efficiencies (TEs) between TLs indicated that the trophic flows primarily went through from TL I to II with a high TE (of over 50{\%}) and through a flow loop or short cut between detritus and TL II but greatly reduced from TL II to III with a lowest TE of 2.5{\%} due to the bulged biomass at TL II. The trophic flow loop greatly increased the throughput recycled, which, together with high connectance index (CI), system omnivory index (SOI), Finn's cycled index (FCI) and Finn's mean path length (FML), might be beneficial to the maintaining of ecosystem stability. Finally, ecosystem property indices showed that this reservoir had a high value of Pp/R and Pp/B, indicating this ecosystem of short history was immature, but highly productive. This silver carp and bighead carp dominated deep reservoir ecosystem had both the characteristics of high productivity of an immature ecosystem and the feature of high stability of a mature ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Numbers of individuals of arthropod species were sampled by direct observation at four sites in each of three different east central Illinois soybean fields at weekly intervals from plant emergence until harvest. Soybean plant development at each field was monitored throughout the season. The number of species detected in a field was greater at the edge (site A) than in the middle (site D). Site A vs. site D differences in numbers of herbivore species were greater than for predator/parasitoid species. Habitat space development (i.e. plant growth) was correlated with the pattern of soybean field colonization by arthropods: a relatively constant number of species per habitat space existed throughout most of the season in all three fields. The mean number of species per habitat space was higher at site A than at site D for both herbivores and predators/parasitoids. A windbreak at the edge of a field concentrated certain aerially dispersed herbivores at the leeward edge early in the season. Arthropod food webs during most of the season were very complex compared to early season trophic relationships. Suggestions for further study, including investigation of the effects of planting time, row-width, and interplanting on seasonal development of the soybean arthropod community are discussed. ?? 1978.},

Four seral stages of decomposition are described for the carcasses: Fresh, Active, Advanced Decay, and Dried. Of 80 arthropod species collected, 63 are identified as participants in the carrion community. Six vertebrate forms were participants. Probable feeding roles of arthropod and vertebrate taxa are presented. Diversity and concentration of dominance were calculated for seral stages, and relationships to resource diversity and food chain complexity are discussed. Removal efficiency of vertebrates and colonization efficiency of arthropods are correlated to describe a probable abbreviation of arthropod carrion communities in small carcasses; possible implication for arthropod adaptations are presented. No direct correlation appeared between carrion community composition and area meteorological conditions.},

abstract = {Tapong Bay, a eutrophic and poorly flushed tropical lagoon, supports intensive oyster culture. Using the Ecopath approach and network analysis, a mass-balanced trophic model was constructed to analyze the structure and matter flows within the food web. The lagoon model is comprised of 18 compartments with the highest trophic level of 3.2 for piscivorous fish. The high pedigree index (0.82) reveals the model to be of high quality. The most-prominent living compartment in terms of matter flow and biomass in the lagoon is cultured oysters and bivalves, respectively. The mixed trophic impacts indicate that phytoplankton and periphyton are the most-influential living compartments in the lagoon. Comparative analyses with the eutrophic and well-flushed Chiku Lagoon and non-eutrophic tropical lagoons show that high nutrient loadings might stimulate the growth and accumulation of phytoplankton and periphyton and therefore support high fishery yields. However, net primary production, total biomass, fishery yields per unit area, and mean transfer efficiency of Tapong Bay were remarkably lower than those of Chiku Lagoon. The lower transfer efficiency likely results from the low mortality of cultured oysters and invasive bivalves from predation or the lower density of benthic feeders constrained by the hypoxic bottom water as a result of poor flushing. This might therefore result in a great proportion of flows to detritus. However, the hypoxic bottom water might further reduce the recycling of the entering detritus back into the food web. In contrast to many estuaries and tropical lagoons, poor flushing of this eutrophic tropical lagoon might induce a shift from detritivory to herbivory in the food web. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Fifty-seven species of oceanic micronekton and macrozooplankton were collected under pack ice during the winter in the vicinity of the Weddell-Scotia Confluence with a modified opening-closing Tucker trawl. The majority of the 57 species did not vertically migrate and lived deeper during the winter than during the spring or fall. However, despite the short day length, several of the most common mesopelagic fish and crustaceans did migrate. Fish moved into shallower depths at night but apparently most did not continue into the near-freezing upper mixed layer, leaving that zone to the migratory crustaceans. In the upper 1000 m, the dominant species were, in order of decreasing biomass, Euphausia superba, the cnidarian Atolla wyvillei, the ctenophore Beroe sp., and the mesopelagic fish Electrona antarctica, Bathylagus antarcticus and Gymnoscopelus braueri. Thysanoessa macrura and Salpa thompsoni were biomass subdominants. The majority of the dominant species showed little seasonal differences in biomass. However, the biomass of gelatinous species varied considerably with A. wyvillei and Beroe sp. being most abundant and S. thompsoni least abundant during the winter. Incidence of food in the stomachs in several important species was low, suggesting a low impact on their zooplankton prey. Specimens of S. thompsoni had high quantities of food in their guts but this species was uncommon so its net impact would also have been low. Euphausia superba and the three common mesopelagic fish had significantly lower stomach fullness ratings during the winter than during the fall, suggesting an overall decrease in feeding activity of dominant species during the winter.},

abstract = {Observations were made on the decomposition of a dead dog during the dry season of 1977 in the Central Valley of Costa Rica, Central America. The terrain is classified as premontane humid forest and the observations were made in a secondary forest. The general pattern of decomposition was basically the same as has been described by authors in other latitudes, but different in the ecological complexity and the insect fauna involved. The classification used for human cadavers by forensic pathologists in Costa Rica and other countries in the American tropics was utilized in this study. It includes the following stages: discoloration, emphysematic (bloated), liquefaction and skeletal remains. The succession of different species appeared to depend on their specific feeding preferences, interspecific competition, and the microclimate provided by the substratum. Marked changes in the activity of populations during crepuscular periods coincided with an increase in relative humidity and a decline in temperature in the macroenvironment of the surrounding forest. Included among the principal insect consumers of the remains were the calliphorid dipterans Phaenicia eximia Wiedemann and Hemilucilia segmentaria Fabricius, the piophilid dipteran Prochyliza azteca McAlpine and the coleopteran Dermestes carnivorus Fabricius. The most important predators were the histerids Euspilotus aenicollis Marshall, Hister punctiger Paykal and Geomysaprinus (Priscosaprinus) belioculus Marshall. Some of these species have also been associated with a similar type of substratum in the tropical rain forest and tropical dry forest in Costa Rica.},

abstract = {1 Quantitative host–parasitoid food webs are descriptions of community structure that include data on the abundance of hosts and parasitoids, and the frequency of links between them, all expressed in the same units. 2 Quantitative host–parasitoid food webs were constructed describing the community of leaf-mining insects (Diptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera) and their parasitoids (Hymenoptera) in an 8500-m 2 area of moist tropical forest in Belize, Central America, over a 1-year period. 3 The summary food web, containing data for the whole year, is we believe the most diverse quantitative host–parasitoid web yet described. It contains 93 species of leaf-miner, 84 species of parasitoid and 196 links between hosts and parasitoids. 4 Most parasitoids were generalists, with individual parasitoid species recorded as parasitizing up to 21 host species. In contrast, most leaf-miners were specialists, with 114 links documented between leaf-miners and their host plants. 5 A robustness analysis was used to reveal the effects of different sampling intensities on food web statistics. The results suggest that the sampling had revealed most of the species of host and parasitoid in the community, but further interactions among species would continue to be detected with additional sampling. Measures of the ratio of hosts to parasitoids and of realized connectance were relatively insensitive to sampling intensity. 6 Three seasonal webs were constructed, revealing temporal changes in the structure of the community. There was greater turnover in host species composition than parasitoid species composition among seasons, but most web statistics remained relatively constant across seasons. 7 Both the summary web and the seasonal webs show low levels of compartmentalization, suggesting that the host–parasitoid community is not divided into relatively discrete subwebs with largely independent dynamics. 8 The extent of potential indirect interactions between pairs of hosts was assessed by constructing quantitative parasitoid overlap graphs. These suggest that abundant species are likely to have greater indirect effects on less abundant species than vice versa , and that species in the same taxonomic order are more likely to interact indirectly. The graphs do not support the hypothesis that species sharing the same host plant are more likely to interact via shared parasitoids.},

abstract = {The structure of the food web was investigated in open waters adjacent to the marginal ice zone in the southern Scotia Sea in spring 1983. Diets were defined for dominant zooplankton, micronekton, and flying seabird species and then aggregated by cluster analysis into feeding groups. Most zooplankton were omnivorous, feeding on phytoplankton, protozoans, and in some cases, small metazoans (copepods). Only two speeies were found to be exclusively herbivorous: Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas. Micronekton were earnivores with eo- pepods being the dominant prey in all their diets. The midwater fish Electrona antarctica was the dominant food item in seven of the nine seabird speeies examined. Cepha- lopods, midwater decapod shrimps and carrion were also important in the diets of a few seabird species. Com- parison (eluster analysis) of diets in spring with other seasons (winter, fall) indicated that over half the speeies examined (18 of 31) had similar diets in all seasons tested. The significant intraspecifie shifts in diet that did occur were attributable to regional, seasonal, and interannual effects. A scheme is presented that describes the major energetic pathways through the open water ecosystem from phytoplankton to apex predators. At the base are phytoplankton and protozoans which are the principal food resource for the biomass copepods and krill. Krill and the biomass copepods are the principal forage of the midwater fish Electrona antarctica which, in turn, is the central diet component of flying seabirds as well as im- portant food for the Antarctie fur seal and cephalopods. Krill area major diet element for the fur seal and eephalo- pods, and the principal food of the minke whale.},

abstract = {Calcium carbonate was preserved more than 1 km below the modern calcite compensation depth (CCD) at ODP Site 1179 over several short intervals around 2.5-2.4, 1.65 and 0.9-0.7 Ma. This anomalous preservation resulted from a combination of increased production of planktonic foraminiferal tests at the sea-surface and increased rate of sedimentation to the sea floor. The abundance of dinoflagellate cysts in calcareous sediments records intense plankton blooms, and the preservation of oxidation-susceptible round brown Brigantedinium cysts in foraminifer-rich samples supports the theory of rapid burial. The rise in sea-surface productivity was driven by enhanced flux of continentally derived limiting nutrients, consistent with the pollen evidence of continental aridification, cooling, and an increase in wind strength. The abundant pollen, dominated by steppe herb and montane-boreal conifer taxa, contrasts with lower pollen concentrations dominated by temperate-subtropical deciduous tree and Taxodium-type pollen in non-calcareous sediments. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

These are swift, stony trout streams flowing on the northern side of a range of hills, and have cool, unpolluted, alkaline, moderately calcareous water, are very constant in flow and have a very stable bed. 2. The fauna of the Clydach has been described in a previous study. The fauna of the Sawdde, examined in July-September 1948, included about 75 species; dominant animals are Atractides brevirostris, Perla carlukiana, Leuctra fusciventris, Ephemerella notata, Baetis rhodani, Glossosoma boltoni and Rhyacophila obliterata. 3. The flora of the Sawdde and the Clydach is described. Fontinalis antipyretica is widely distributed and abundant at some points. Ulothrix is the dominant green alga. There is a rich diatom flora; characteristic species are Diatoma vulgare, Ceratoneis arcus, Achnanthes spp., Cocconeis placentula and Navicula viridula. 4. The food of the dominant insect species has been studied and about 600 specimens were examined for gut contents. Perla carlukiana, Dinocras cephalotes, Rhyacophila obliterata and Plectrocnemia conspersa are the chief predatory species; Baetis, Ephemerella, Simulium and chironomid larvae are their most frequent prey. The common mayflies are entirely herbivorous; Baetis feeds upon Ulothrix and other green algae, detritus and diatoms; Ecdyonurus mainly upon detritus; Siphlonurus upon the leaves of higher plants and detritus; Ephemerella upon Ulothrix and Fontinalis. Ecdyonurus venosus and certain other common animals in the stream system are apparently able to escape being eaten by the predatory Plecoptera and Trichoptera. Of the common, larger insects Philopotamus montanus is the only species mainly dependent on diatoms.},

abstract = {Riverine food webs are often laterally disconnected (i.e. between watercourses) in regulated floodplain wetlands for prolonged periods. We compared the trophic structure of benthic resources and consumers (crustaceans and fish) of the three watercourses in a regulated floodplain wetland (the Gwydir Wetlands, Australia) that shared the same source water but were laterally disconnected. The crustaceans Cherax destructor (yabby), Macrobrachium australiense (freshwater prawn), the exotic fish Cyprinus carpio (European carp) and Carassius auratus (goldfish) showed significantly different d13C values among the watercourses, suggesting spatial differences in primary carbon sources. Trophic positions were estimated by using d15N values of benthic organic matter as the base of the food web in each watercourse. The estimated trophic positions and gut contents showed differences in trophic positions and feeding behaviours of consumers between watercourses, in particular for Melanotaenia fluviatilis (Murray–Darling rainbowfish) and M. australiense. Our findings suggest that the observed spatial variation in trophic structure appears to be largely related to the spatial differences in the extent and type of riparian vegetation (i.e. allochthonous carbon source) across the floodplain that most likely constituted part of the benthic resources},

abstract = {Pollination webs have recently deepened our understanding of complex ecosystem functions and the susceptibility of biotic networks to anthropogenic disturbances. Extensive mutualistic networks from tropical species-rich communities, however, are extremely scarce. We present fully quantitative pollination webs of two plant-pollinator communities of natural heathland sites, one of which was in the process of being restored, on the oceanic island of Mauritius. The web interaction data cover a full flowering season from September 2003 to March 2004 and include all flowering plant and their pollinator species. Pollination webs at both sites were dominated by a few super-abundant, disproportionately well-connected species, and many rare and specialised species. The webs differed greatly in size, reflecting higher plant and pollinator species richness and abundance at the restored site. About one fifth of plant species at the smaller community received {\textless}3 visits. The main pollinators were insects from diverse taxonomic groups, while the few vertebrate pollinator species were abundant and highly linked. The difference in plant community composition between sites appeared to strongly affect the associated pollinator community and interactions with native plant species. Low visitation rate to introduced plant species suggested little indirect competition for pollinators with native plant species. Overall, our results indicated that the community structure was highly complex in comparison to temperate heathland communities. We discuss the observed differences in plant linkage and pollinator diversity and abundance between the sites with respect to habitat restoration management and its influence on pollination web structure and complexity. For habitat restoration to be successful in the long term, practitioners should aim to maintain structural diversity to support a species-rich and abundant pollinator assemblage which ensures native plant reproduction. {\textcopyright} 2009 R{\"{u}}bel Foundation, ETH Z{\"{u}}rich.},

abstract = {Larvae of M. autumnalis reared under optimal conditions in the laboratory showed a 76.2{\%} survivorship, plus or minus 1.9{\%}.  In the field, face fly larvae suffered a larger mortality.  For 3 sets of field measurements only 44.9{\%}, plus or minus 22.4{\%}, 36.9{\%}, plus or minus 6.9{\%}, and 12.0{\%}, plus or minus 6.0{\%} reached the pupal stage.  Most of this field mortality took place very early in the larval development.  Potential mortality factors were then independently evaluated in an attempt to account for the field mortality.  Temperature appeared to act as a lethal factor only in the high temperature range.  A consideration of natural history and physical properties led to the assumption that high temperatures as found on the top surface of droppings could exert their effect only on the egg and first instar stages.  The temperature regimes of each of the field trials led to predicting heat mortalities only in 1 (21.8{\%}) out of 3 trials.  moisture content and pH of dung were quite constant.  An examination of the biological properties of face fly larvae showed that these variables were dubious contributors to the mortality budget.  Competition for food led to a reduction in pupal weight when larval densities were high, regardless of whether the competitors were other face fly larvae or other species.  At lower densities, pupal weights also decreased, but in this case mortality increased, perhaps because a critical minimal density is needed for the proper liquefaction of the substrate to make available enough food for the filter-feeding larvae.  This effect of undercrowding was not large enough to cause significant mortality in the field trials.  Parasitism was unimportant as far as face fly larvae were concerned.  Predators (Philonthus cruentatus) in the field experiments caused 38.4{\%}, plus or minus 7.7{\%} larval mortality if burrowing beetles (Sphaeridium scarabaeoides) were present.  Predatory mortality was reduce if the burrowers were absent, indicating some sort of synergistic interaction.  A rougher second estimate based on prey consumption rates suggest that predators could have reduced face fly populations by 51.4, 47.9 and 45.7 percent in the field trials.  Laboratory experiments showed that the bulk of predation occurred during the egg and first instar stages.  The laboratory predation experiments provided a third corroborative mortality prediction of 42.3{\%} with burrowers present.  Predatory actions by birds, though possibly important, were discounted since they were outside the scope of this study.  When an estimate of physiological death at each of 4 time intervals was removed from field survival, the remainders estimated true field mortality for each trial.  These remainders for the 3 trials can be shown to be similar.  Further, the overall mortalities for the field trials were quite close to the results of both field and laboratory predation experiments.  The addition of all the mortality components furnished a predicted set of mortalities that tended to be somewhat larger than the observed values.  However, the overall fit between predicted and observed survival rates was good.  The independent experimental evaluations of potential mortality factors furnished an adequate manner with which to judge the relative importance of each factor and yielded a good overall mortality prediction.  Interactions and overlaps between mortality factors were not accounted for in this study.  A study of these factors could provide better and more realistic prediction and models.  However, the variability intrinsic to the system and the errors of measurement may limit the detail of the analysis even if proper experimental design is used.  Better evaluation of these sources of error is needed before further field work is attempted.},

abstract = {1. Invasive alien plant species pose a severe threat to native plant communities world-wide, especially on islands. While many studies focus on the direct impact of alien plants on native systems, indirect effects of plant invaders on co-flowering natives, for example through competition for pollination services, are less well studied and the results are variable.  2. We used six temporally and taxonomically highly resolved plant–pollinator networks from the island of Mah{\'{e}}, Seychelles, to investigate the indirect impact of invasive alien plant species on remnant native plant communities mediated by shared pollinators. We employed fully quantitative network parameters and information on plant reproductive success, and pollinator diversity and behaviour, to detect changes in plant–pollinator networks along an invasion gradient.  3. The number of visits to and fruit set of native plants did not change with invasion intensity. Weighted plant linkage and interaction evenness, however, was lower at invaded sites than at less invaded sites. These patterns were primarily driven by shifts in interactions of the most common pollinator, the introduced honey bee Apis mellifera, while weak interactions and strong native interactions remained unchanged.  4.Synthesis. The implications of these findings are twofold: first, quantitative network parameters are important tools for detecting underlying biological patterns. Secondly, alien plants and pollinators may play a greater role in shaping network structure at high than low levels of invasion. We could not show, however, whether the presence of invasive plants result in a simplification of plant–pollinator networks that is detrimental to native plants and pollinators alike.},

abstract = {Arthropod species invade fresh dung in an orderly pattern and the number of taxa and the complexity of the food web increase as succession takes place. Short-term, local changes in the environment during early succession seem to have a more pervasive effect on species abundance than seasonal changes. The interactions between burrowing and predatory beetles, and large and small diptera larvae are the core of the food webs in dung succession. Burrowing beetles arrive early and remain throughout succession. Their tunnels riddle the dung and are used by the air-breathing fly larvae to reach the interior of the dropping. Predatory beetles lack adaptations for burrowing but may use burrows already excavated to reach the otherwise unavailable fly larvae. The presence of burrowers, therefore, facilitates predation. The predators involved can feed only on small prey 0.5-6.0 mm long. The larvae of larger flies found early in dung succession are able quickly to outgrow this size range, and escape predation. There is a second group of small fly larvae that then enters this size range and remains exposed to predation for the duration of succession. Competition for dung is not likely to be a major limitation for dung feeder populations since excess dung seems available. Similarly, estimates of prey needed by predators are smaller than the standing crops of prey available. Predation does not appear to be limiting to prey populations. Similarly, predators themselves are unlikely to be prey-limited. Local, short-term changes in dung and in the immediate environment may be too fast and too erratic to permit fuller use of dung as a resource. The frequent occurrence of introduced species in dung composition may be related to the lack of competition and predation pressure in dung-inhabiting arthropods. The initial stages of dung succession, as in most other new environments, are largely determined by factors other than competition and predation.},

abstract = {The benthic food web of the deep Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC) was modelled by using the linear inverse modelling methodology. The reconstruction of carbon pathways by inverse analysis was based on benthic oxygen uptake rates, biomass data and transfer of labile carbon through the food web as revealed by a pulse-chase experiment. Carbon deposition was estimated at 2.2mmolCm-2d-1. Approximately 69{\%} of the deposited carbon was respired by the benthic community with bacteria being responsible for 70{\%} of the total respiration. The major fraction of the labile detritus flux was recycled within the microbial loop leaving merely 2{\%} of the deposited labile phytodetritus available for metazoan consumption. Bacteria assimilated carbon at high efficiency (0.55) but only 24{\%} of bacterial production was grazed by metazoans; the remaining returned to the dissolved organic matter pool due to viral lysis. Refractory detritus was the basal food resource for nematodes covering ???99{\%} of their carbon requirements. On the contrary, macrofauna seemed to obtain the major part of their metabolic needs from bacteria (49{\%} of macrofaunal consumption). Labile detritus transfer was well-constrained, based on the data from the pulse-chase experiment, but appeared to be of limited importance to the diet of the examined benthic organisms ({\textless}1{\%} and 5{\%} of carbon requirements of nematodes and macrofauna respectively). Predation on nematodes was generally low with the exception of sub-surface deposit-feeding polychaetes that obtained 35{\%} of their energy requirements from nematode ingestion. Carnivorous polychaetes also covered 35{\%} of their carbon demand through predation although the preferred prey, in this case, was other macrofaunal animals rather than nematodes. Bacteria and detritus contributed 53{\%} and 12{\%} to the total carbon ingestion of carnivorous polychaetes suggesting a high degree of omnivory among higher consumers in the FSC benthic food web. Overall, this study provided a unique insight into the functioning of a deep-sea benthic community and demonstrated how conventional data can be exploited further when combined with state-of-the-art modelling approaches. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In large deep oligotrophic lakes, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the shallow nearshore water provides disproportionately important feeding and breeding habitat for the whole-lake food web. We examined the trophic importance of the nearshore environment, human impacts nearshore, and several approaches to disturbance detection in a deep (190 m) oligotrophic lake with relatively modest residential development. In Lake Crescent, on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington (USA), stable isotope analysis demonstrated that apex salmonid predators derived more than 50{\%}of their carbon from nearshore waters, even though this nearshore water accounted for only 2.5{\%} of total lake volume. Unfortunately, it is this land–water interface that is initially degraded as shorelines are developed. We hypothesised that under these conditions of relatively modest disturbance, the effects of residential development would be strongly localised near to shore. Indeed,wefound striking differences between developed and undeveloped sites in periphyton and associated organic matter, though there were no offshore signals of human impact in water nutrient analysis or paleolimnological investigations. Together, these results suggest that nearshore biological monitoring should be integrated in lake management plans to provide ‘early warning' of potential food-web repercussions before pollution problems are evident in open water and comparatively intractable.},

abstract = {biological tractability of current concepts of the organization of natural communities. Experimental communities with a known composition of mature eggs were introduced into screen enclosures in a pond to assay the importance of competition and predation to the ecology of amphibian larvae in temporary ponds. The competitive ability of each population was measured by its survivorship, mean length of its larval period, and mean weight at metamorphosis. Three simultaneous experiments (requiring 70 enclosures and 137 populations) were replicated in a randomized complete-block design for variance analysis. The assumptions of the classical Lotka-Volterra model of competition were tested by raising Ambystoma laterale, Ambystoma tremblayi, and Ambystoma maculatum in all combinations of three initial densities (0, 32, and 64). All three measures of competitive ability were affected by competition with other species. Higher-order interactions decreased the variance of the outcomes of the experiments as species were added to the communities. The statistical effects of these higher-order interactions between the densities of competing species often exceeded the simple effects of competition. The increase in community stability with the addition of species to the community is not predicted by the classical models of community ecology. The second experiment tested the effects of adjacent trophic levels on the structure of the three-species community. Eggs of Ambystoma tigrinum, a predator, and Rana sylvatica, an alternate prey of Ambystoma tigrinum, were added singly and together into systems with 16 eggs of species in the Maculatum species-group. Ambystoma tigrinum was a predator if it acquired an initial size advantage by preying on Rana sylvatica tadpoles; otherwise it was principally a competitor. Rana sylvatica adversely affected the Maculatum group by competing with invertebrate prey for periphyton and photoplankton. The three species in the Maculatum group had nearly the same response to the addition of both A. tigrinum and R. sylvatica. Ambystoma texanum, which occurs sporadically in southern Michigan at the northern limit of its range but not on the study area, was introduced as a test for community saturation. Ambystoma texanum was successfully raised alone. When mixed with the Maculatum group, Ambystoma texanum had a low survivorship, a small body size, and a long larval period. The native species were affected equally by the introduction of Ambystoma texanum, demonstrating the complexity of the food web and the ecological pliability of salamander larvae. The uncertainty of the temporary pond environment precludes extreme ecological specialization among these species of salamanders. Coexistence is a consequence of the relative advantages of the species in different years and the long adult life spans. The complexity of the food web and "predator switching" are probably important elements of the densitydependent interactions that contribute to the stability of communities within seasons.},

The main emphasis was on the transfer of primary production to herbivores since this process dominates the flow of matter within the food web. Biomass size distributions offer an ecosystem approach which relies only on measurements of biomass and a few general assumptions, whereas network analysis is predominantly based on production estimates and requires more detailed knowledge of the ecosystem. Despite these differences, both approaches give consistent results for both the absolute values of the transfer efficiencies and seasonal trends. Estimates of the seasonally averaged transfer efficiency (dominated by the utilization of primary production by herbivores) range from 0.20 to 0.27. They are considerably lower in late winter and spring (0.05 to 0.21) than in summer and autumn (0.25 to 0.38, extreme values: 0.20 and 0.42). ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Based on the stable isotope composition in 15N and 13C of different potential sources of organic matter and consumers of an intertidal Zostera marina meadow located in San Sim??n Bay (R??a de Vigo, NW of Spain), a simplified food web of this community was reconstructed. For this purpose, some alternatives in different steps of the most used methodology of stable isotope dietary analysis were developed that cope with some of the limitations associated to the interpretation of isotopic signals for food web analysis, those of uncertainty on the fractionation value, mathematical model to use for the diet resolution and shortage of the isotope number for discriminating many food sources. The application of this protocol to the studied community reported similar results to those from other studies based on similar trophic webs, emphasizing the importance of local primary producers, especially microphytobenthos, which could be available for several primary consumers through resuspension forced by tidal hydrodynamic. The good agreement with previous results suggests that the proposed protocol is a feasible alternative to elucidate the most plausible trophic relationships in complex trophic webs using stable isotopes analysis. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Force1974,
abstract = {Although conclusive evidence is lacking for its establishment, the thesis that complexity adds stability to communities is probably accepted by the majority of ecologists. I believe this attitude found its origins in the indisputable fact that there are latitudinal and altitudinal changes in community complexity. As one progresses northward or southward from the equator, or higher in altitude in most parts of the world, one cannot help but notice that communities tend to become simpler, that is, there are fewer species per community. At the same time, these communities appear to become less stable. But perhaps this change in stability is in appearance only; they appear to be less stable because of the relatively greater number of individuals comprising each species population in temperate areas. Each population, because of its greater numbers, is therefore conspicuous, and changes in these numbers are noticed. We are particularly aware of such changes because populations in these areas of the world have been comparatively well studied. Many of the most studied populations include species of economic importance where changes in population numbers are vital to agricultural or forestry practices. Equatorial populations, on the other hand, contain smaller numbers of individuals of each species because of the greater number of species present. Number changes are simply not as noticeable because the population itself is not as obvious among the other populations. It may be that when (if ever) we have as much data on equatorial populations as we have on those of temperate climates, we will find fluctuations of equal relative magnitude (but not of equal numbers, of course). If, on the other hand, we really do find a correlation between complexity and stability, the suggestion by May (12) that stability permits complexity may be well worth investigating. Because of its organization and physical setting, the Rhopalomyia community I have studied might be expected to have considerable stability. In fact, however, it does not. Each of the populations in the community fluctuates greatly and irregularly in both percentages and numbers, and these populations apparently become locally extinct occasionally, because they sometimes cannot be found even in extensive collections. After studying several of the more important parasitoid species, it is evident to me that there is little or nothing about their interactions that might induce greater community stability. Each species seems to have evolved into the community with no higher purpose than simply to usurp what it can from some other member, and it does this by concentrating its energies on better competitive mechanisms rather than higher reproductive capacities. There are never empty niches to be filled by organisms having the "correct specifications" because new niches are created out of parts of older, broader niches which were occupied by other, more r-selected organisms. Thus, perhaps we have read too much into community organization. Perhaps the "ifiling of niches" is essentially nothing more than the haphazard result of competitive jostling among species; and that as communities develop, they are not necessarily programmed for such things as greater stability or better energy utilizationthe species merely become more closely packed.},

abstract = {The community trophic structure of Morgan's Creek, Meade County, Kentucky was analyzed through regular measurement of standing crops of the chief potential sources of plant materials available to the animals (suspended particulate, attached particulate, and allochthonous leaf materials) and an examination of their gut contents. The most important food was allochthonous leaf materials, which occurred as suspended material in the water, as a component of materials attached to the streambed, and as whole leaves and fragments. Diatoms were the only other important source of plant materials and constituted the greatest proportion of the attached organic fraction. Mean standing crop measurements of potential foods for five sampling stations ranged from 0.6 to 1.0 kcal/m3 for suspended particulate organic matter; 12 to 19 kcal/m2 for attached particulate organic matter; and 4.7 to 13 kcal/m2 for allochthonous leaf materials. Comparison of standing crop data with previous findings indicates that the values generally are within the known ranges for flowing waters. Analysis of gut contents and determination of the principal pathways of energy flow in the stream indicate that imported organic matter in the form of allochthonous leaf materials provides the main source of energy for the primary consumers and, indirectly, for the entire benthic community of Morgan's Creek. Of the 37 taxa of animals studied, 24 were herbivores, 5 omnivores, and 8 carnivores. In general, detritus made up from 50 to 100{\%} of all the materials ingested by both the herbivores and omnivores. The total number of benthic animals was comprised of 14{\%} herbivores, 83{\%} omnivores, and 3{\%} carnivores. Gammarus minus was the single most important member of the fauna. It contributed 81{\%} of the total number of invertebrates, and well over 90{\%} of its diet consisted of allochthonous leaf detritus.},

abstract = {Changes in seagrass food-web structure can shift the competitive balance between seagrass and algae, and may alter the flow of energy from lower trophic levels to commercially important fish and crustaceans. Yet, trophic relationships in many seagrass systems remain poorly resolved. We estimated the food web linkages among small predators, invertebrate mesograzers, and primary producers in a Chesapeake Bay eelgrass (Zostera marina) bed by analyzing gut contents and stable C and N isotope ratios. Though trophic levels were relatively distinct, predators varied in the proportion of mesograzers consumed relative to alternative prey, and some mesograzers consumed macrophytes or exhibited intra-guild predation in addition to feeding on periphyton and detritus. These findings corroborate conclusions from lab and mesocosm studies that the ecological impacts of mesograzers vary widely among species, and they emphasize the need for taxonomic resolution and ecological information within seagrass epifaunal communities. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2011 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.},

abstract = {Studies of the community composition, structure and species interrelationships of the Endocladia-Balanus association were carried out on the rocky shores at the Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, California, over the period 1959—1961. The organisms making up this biotic association form a horizontal band approximately two feet wide on intertidal rocks. The center of this belt averaged 4.6 ft in surveyed height above tidal datum, but field observations showed that the periods of exposure and submersion actually experienced under a variety of conditions at this level are those predicted for a level of about 3.8 ft above tidal datum. Selected aspects of the relatively mild marine and terrestrial climates were studied in relation to the high and low water periods. The composition of the association was determined from quadrat samples, qualitative collections and field observations. A total of at least 93 benthic and transient species was enumerated, belonging to 15 major groups. Samples taken near the center of the association in different areas and at different seasons demonstrated great similarity and stability in species composition. Thirty-five of the species present in the assemblage were of common occurrence, and where feasible the following aspects of the biology of each were studied: (a) habitat niche, (b) activity patterns, (c) organic matter content of the body (based on the dry weight and nitrogen content), (d) seasonal occurrence, (e) population structure, (f) reproductive activity, (g) food relationships, and (h) growth rate. The most characteristic species were: Rhodophyta-Endocladia muricata, Gigartina agardhii; Platyhelminthes-Notoplana acticola; Nemertea- Emplectonema gracile, Nemertopsis gracilis; Annelida-Syllis spenceri, S. vittata, S. armillaris, Nereis grubei, Perinereis monterea; Bryozoa- Filicrisia franciscana; Mollusca (8 gastropods, 1 chiton, and 3 bivalves)- Acmaea digitalis, A. scabra, A. pelta, Littorina scutulata, L. planaxis, Acanthina spirata, Thais emarginata, Tegula funebralis, Cyanoplax dentiens, Lasaea cistula, Mytilus californianus, Musculus sp.; Arthropoda (7 crustaceans, 2 insects, and 3 mites)- Balanus glandula, Chthamalus dalli, C. microtretus, Dynamenella glabra, Allorchestes ptilocerus, Hyale sp., Pachygrapsus crassipes, Diaulota densissima, Limonia marmorata, Agauopsis sp., a mesostigmatid mite, and Suidasia sp. A study of space relations shows that a multitude of species live among the holdfast branchlets and along the blades of E. muricata, and in the spaces formed by the tests of both living and dead B. glandula. Food studies of the 34 commonest animal species show that seven are filter feeders, ten are herbivorous browsers and scrapers feeding on encrusting forms, six are herbivores feeding on the large benthic algae, five are omnivores and scavengers, and six are carnivores which prey mostly on filter feeders and scraping herbivores. Pelagic materials present during high tide periods, in order of decreasing absolute volume, were: (a) large plant fragments, (b) phytoplankton, (c) other organic detritus, (d) zooplankton, and (e) inorganic detritus. Approximately 570 mg dry weight was available per m³ of sea water throughout the year. For the center of the Endocladia-Balanus zone the mean number of individuals above microscopic size of all species present at any time was 210,000/ m², the mean dry weight biomass was 2,640 g/m², and the mean nitrogen content was 25 g/m². In quantitative as well as qualitative terms, the Endocladia-Balanus association shows considerable similarity with the Gloiopeltis- Chthamalus association in the Sea of Japan and with the Chthamalus-Pygmaea zone on English rocky shores. Analysis of the association in terms of the protein content of the standing crop for the major trophic groups shows the following: filter feeding animals, 84 g/m²; larger red algae and their attached epiphytes, 58 g/m²; resident herbivores, 12 g/m²; a transient herbivore, 1.2 g/m²; resident carnivores, 0.9 g/m²; transient carnivores, 0.8 g/m²; omnivores and scavengers, 1.3 g/m². Although the scraping and grazing herbivores feed on algae produced in the zone, much of the food consumed in the association is derived by import of suspended detritus and plankton at high water.},

This paper aims to quantify energy flows in the Itaipu Reservoir (Brazil) and to simulate increase of the fishing effort of some species, using Ecopath with Ecosim software, which could allow inferences on stability. Therefore, two steady-state Itaipu models were built (1983-87 and 1988-92). Results showed that: a) there are no differences between models, and results on aging trends do not vary over time indicating that fishery does not alter the ecosystem as a whole; b) results of fisheries simulations are approximate to mono-specific stock assessment for the same species and periods; c) many authors believe that tropical ecosystems are environments where biotic and abiotic oscillations are annual and sometimes unexpected, but the results found for the Itaipu Reservoir indicate that stability was met after 16 years.},

The modeled ecosystem showed maturity because of the total primary production/total respiration ratio (close to 2), Finn's cycling index (7{\%}) and overhead (65{\%}). The first model elaborated had 40 compartments/groups, but its transfer efficiencies among trophic levels did not reduce in despite the trophic level increasing. To solve this, the effect of two grouping methods on system-level information and other ecosystem attributes was investigated. The first series tested, named "classic" (researcher intuitive way and by food preferences) also did not reduce transfer efficiencies. In the second series, named "by pathways", the first species grouping were those with higher number of input pathways and longest mean length of pathways. Thereby, the news groups from aggregation decreased the number of components and system's richness, but stability (measured by overhead) did not change, including the model with only eight compartments. The great number of the ten compartments that showed these characteristics was piscivores, increasing the redundancy within highest trophic level. The use of pathways (number and length) can be useful to lumping species since it reduces compartments and do compromise neither maturity nor stability, diminishing grouping subjectivity. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we study the relationships between predator and prey size, body-mass ratios and predator trophic levels using body-mass estimates of 1313 predators (invertebrates, ectotherm and endotherm vertebrates) from 35 food-webs (marine, stream, lake and terrestrial). Across all ecosystem and predator types, except for streams (which appear to have a different size structure in their predator-prey interactions), we find that (1) geometric mean prey mass increases with predator mass with a power-law exponent greater than unity and (2) predator size increases with trophic level. Consistent with our theoretical derivations, we show that the quantitative nature of these relationships implies systematic decreases in predator-prey body-mass ratios with the trophic level of the predator. Thus, predators are, on an average, more similar in size to their prey at the top of food-webs than that closer to the base. These findings contradict the traditional Eltonian paradigm and have implications for our understanding of body-mass constraints on food-web topology, community dynamics and stability.},

abstract = {Introduced species can alter the topology of food webs. For instance, an introduction can aid the arrival of free-living consumers using the new species as a resource, while new parasites may also arrive with the introduced species. Food-web responses to species additions can thus be far more complex than anticipated. In a subarctic pelagic food web with free-living and parasitic species, two fish species (arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus and three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus) have known histories as deliberate introductions. The effects of these introductions on the food web were explored by comparing the current pelagic web with a heuristic reconstruction of the pre-introduction web. Extinctions caused by these introductions could not be evaluated by this approach. The introduced fish species have become important hubs in the trophic network, interacting with numerous parasites, predators and prey. In particular, five parasite species and four predatory bird species depend on the two introduced species as obligate trophic resources in the pelagic web and could therefore not have been present in the pre-introduction network. The presence of the two introduced fish species and the arrival of their associated parasites and predators increased biodiversity, mean trophic level, linkage density, and nestedness; altering both the network structure and functioning of the pelagic web. Parasites, in particular trophically transmitted species, had a prominent role in the network alterations that followed the introductions.},

abstract = {Energetic and dynamic constraints have been proposed as rival factors in determining food-web structure. Food- web length might be controlled either by the amount of energy entering the web (energetic constraints) or by time span between consecutive disturbances relative to time needed to build up a population (dynamic constraints). Dynamic constraints are identiﬁed with processes functioning at a regional scale such as climate, lithology and hydrogeology. Energetic constraints are related with processes operating both at a regional and a local scale. We studied the contribution of energetic constraints to food-web organization in two temporary saline lakes with similar dynamic constraints. Lakes were sampled fortnightly during two hydroperiods (1994/1995 and 1995/1996). Differences in energetic constraints between lakes result in divergent assemblages of primary producers. Consumer assemblages in both lakes, however, are similar in species composition although differ in total biomass and species abundances. Food-webs are short with a high proportion of omnivores. To simulate an increase in the energy input entering to these systems, an addition of nutrients (to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 µg{\textperiodcentered}l −1 P-PO4 3−) was done in mesocosms placed within the lakes in order to obtain an increase in the phytoplankton biomass. No signiﬁcant response to nutrient enrichment was found in food-web structure (composition, density or biomass)},

abstract = {Species, biomasses, production rates, distribution and other aspects of the community structure have been studied in the Antarctic Ecosystem; however there are no integrated models that explain mass transfer at the spatial mesoscale. Even though the Antarctic Ecosystem as a whole has been identified as a functional unit, subsystems could be identified and characterized, among which, the Antarctic Peninsula stands out for its particular geography, oceanography and trophic web. The aim of this work is to construct a mass balanced model describing the main trophic interactions of this community. The model is built using the software Ecopath with Ecosim 5.0, which yields a representation of the trophic web and estimations of global ecosystem properties. Phytoplankton, zooplankton and krill accounted for most of the mass flow. Flows to the trophic level II (TL II; detritivores and herbivores) were attributed to zooplanktonic and benthic organisms mainly. Flows to the TL III were explained by fish, birds (flying birds and penguins), Balaenoptera acutorostrata and baleen whales. Flows to the TL IV were dominated by some fish, birds (flying birds and penguins) and mammals. Finally, in TL VI, the flows were dominated by Orcinus orca. O. orca was the top predator in the ecosystem with a TL of 4.88, followed by Physeter catodon (4.63) and Hydrurga leptonyx (4.62). Krill was found at the intermediate TL (2.33). Resulting ecosystem indexes (e.g. total transfer efficiency, connectance index, etc.) were consistent and characteristic of ecosystems of high temporal and spatial variability. The model gives a comprehensive description of the food web dominated by phytoplankton-krill-top predators chain, and complemented with alternative food pathways (e.g. through Electrona antarctica), which together gives an enhanced complexity to the system. Despite the limitations of the model in data gaps, particularly for winter season, grouping of functional groups, steady state assumptions, etc., it improves the description of the trophic structure and ecosystem functioning of the Antarctic Peninsula and highlights gaps in knowledge. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Alvarado is one of the most productive estuary-lagoon systems in the Mexican Gulf of Mexico. It has great economic and ecological importance due to high fisheries productivity and because it serves as a nursery, feeding, and reproduction area for numerous populations of fishes and crustaceans. Because of this, extensive studies have focused on biology, ecology, fisheries (e.g. shrimp, oysters) and other biological components of the system during the last few decades. This study presents a mass-balanced trophic model for Laguna Alvarado to determine it's structure and functional form, and to compare it with similar coastal systems of the Gulf of Mexico and Mexican Pacific coast. The model, based on the software Ecopath with Ecosim, consists of eighteen fish groups, seven invertebrate groups, and one group each of sharks and rays, marine mammals, phytoplankton, sea grasses and detritus. The acceptability of the model is indicated by the pedigree index (0.5) which range from 0 to 1 based on the quality of input data. The highest trophic level was 3.6 for marine mammals and snappers. Total system throughput reached 2680 t km-2 year-1, of which total consumption made up 47{\%}, respiratory flows made up 37{\%} and flows to detritus made up 16{\%}. The total system production was higher than consumption, and net primary production higher than respiration. The mean transfer efficiency was 13.8{\%}. The mean trophic level of the catch was 2.3 and the primary production required to sustain the catch was estimated in 31 t km-2 yr-1. Ecosystem overhead was 2.4 times the ascendancy. Results suggest a balance between primary production and consumption. In contrast with other Mexican coastal lagoons, Laguna Alvarado differs strongly in relation to the primary source of energy; here the primary producers (seagrasses) are more important than detritus pathways. This fact can be interpreted a response to mangrove deforest, overfishing, etc. Future work might include the compilation of fishing and biomass time trends to develop historical verification and fitting of temporal simulations. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was verify if species composition were the same at three different habitats in Corrente River. If species composition were the same it will allow to model the food web by a single model, otherwise each portion should be modeled independently. Ecopath model and the keystoneness index (KSi) were used in order to evaluate the entire food web and to comprehend the system control. Five surveys in the period from June of 2003 to until June of 2005 were carried out in three different habitats in the river. Results showed that: i) there are seven fish species; ii) habitats are very similar; iii) all species reproduced in the rainy season with exception of Brycon nattereri. A single Ecopath model indicated low resilience and stability. Keystoneness rank values showed a mixed system control mechanism, where one predator, Salminus hilarii, one intermediate consumer, Astyanax altiparanae and one consumer of trophic level two (terrestrial invertebrates) had respectively, the highest keystoneness index values.},

abstract = {Flood pulse and biotic interrelationships control the food web dynamics of river floodplain systems. The Pantanal Plain in the Paraguay River Basin (Brazil) occupies 140,000km2 of periodically flooded areas and is divided into 12 subregions with different characteristics related to the flood pulse duration, the vegetation, the type of soil, and the resources used in activities, particularly fishing. In this study, we used Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) to model three oxbow lakes in the South Pantanal Plain, where there is no fishing activity, to test the similarity of the ecosystems, to identify the keystone species and the types of food web controls, and to determine whether these environments can support moderated fishing pressure. We found that the food webs of the oxbow lakes are similar to each other because, although they depend mainly on the presence or absence of predators, flood pulses similarly homogenize the lakes. The results highlight the importance of detritus in these food webs. In addition, the highest values of the keystoneness species index in the three models highlight the role of top predators (Hoplias malabaricus, Serrasalmus spp., Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum, birds, and mammals). Therefore, we suggest that the food webs in the three systems are subjected to an alternated control process: detritus controls the food web during the flood season and by the top predators during the dry season. The simulation outputs indicate that these oxbow lakes can sustain only moderate fishing because increasing the fishing pressure reduces the biodiversity and can negatively impact the top predators. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In Australia's Wet Tropics rivers, perennial base flows punctuated by wet season floods drive instream responses across a range of spatial and temporal scales. We combined gut-content and stable-isotope analyses to produce preliminary webs depicting trophic links between fish, their main prey items and basal productivity sources. We then used these webs to test the applicability of general food web principles developed in other tropical systems. Although a range of sources appeared to underpin fish productivity, a large portion of total energy transfer occurred through a subset of trophic links. Variability in food web structure was negatively correlated with spatial scale, being seasonally stable at river reaches and variable at smaller scales. Wet Tropics rivers are similar to those in other tropical areas, but exhibit some unique characteristics. Their high degree of channel incision improves longitudinal connectivity, thereby allowing fish to move between mesohabitats and target their preferred prey items, rather than shifting their diet as resources fluctuate. However, this also inhibits lateral connectivity and limits terrestrial energy inputs from beyond the littoral zone.},

abstract = {Measuring the numerical abundance and average body size of individuals of each species in an ecological community's food web reveals new patterns and illuminates old ones. This approach is illustrated using data from the pelagic community of a small lake: Tuesday Lake, Michigan, United States. Body mass varies almost 12 orders of magnitude. Numerical abundance varies almost 10 orders of magnitude. Biomass abundance (average body mass times numerical abundance) varies only 5 orders of magnitude. A new food web graph, which plots species and trophic links in the plane spanned by body mass and numerical abundance, illustrates the nearly inverse relationship between body mass and numerical abundance, as well as the pattern of energy flow in the community. Species with small average body mass occur low in the food web of Tuesday Lake and are numerically abundant. Larger-bodied species occur higher in the food web and are numerically rarer. Average body size explains more of the variation in numerical abundance than does trophic height. The trivariate description of an ecological community by using the food web, average body sizes, and numerical abundance includes many well studied bivariate and univariate relationships based on subsets of these three variables. We are not aware of any single community for which all of these relationships have been analyzed simultaneously. Our approach demonstrates the connectedness of ecological patterns traditionally treated as independent. Moreover, knowing the food web gives new insight into the disputed form of the allometric relationship between body mass and abundance.},

The moderate to low upwelling year of 1981 showed a generally high overall trophic diversity and a low level of diet overlap and food web complexity. During the relatively strong upwelling year of 1982, euphausiids were the dominant food consumed, resulting in high dietary overlap and low trophic diversity and food web complexity.

Ten trophic guilds were identified from cluster analysis. Benthic prey dominated the diets. However, analysis on a subset of 28 abundant species that were commercially and ecologically important, showed that pelagic prey was dominant, particularly for 12 quota species. This suggests that pelagic production contributes significantly to the trawl fishery production. Further analysis on the diets of these 28 species found that although fish was more important than invertebrate prey, there was no evidence of significant predation on commercially important species (quota species) by other fish species. A food web diagram was constructed, mostly based on the diet compositions, guild structure and relative abundance of commercially and ecologically important fish species, to show major trophic interactions of the shelf ecosystem.},

Such understanding is severely limited by mechanistic models' inability to reproduce the dynamics of multiple populations interacting in the field. We surpass this limitation here by extending general consumer-resource network theory to the complex dynamics of a specific ecosystem comprised by the seasonal biomass and production patterns in a pelagic food web of a large, well-studied lake. We parameterised our allometric trophic network model of 24 guilds and 107 feeding relationships using the lake's food web structure, initial spring biomasses and body-masses. Adding activity respiration, the detrital loop, minimal abiotic forcing, prey resistance and several empirically observed rates substantially increased the model's fit to the observed seasonal dynamics and the size-abundance distribution. This process illuminates a promising approach towards improving food-web theory and dynamic models of specific habitats.},

abstract = {Human-mediated and natural disturbances such as nutrient enrichment, habitat modification, and flood events often result in significant shifts in species composition and abundance that translate into changes in the food web structure. Six mass-balanced models were developed using the " Ecopath with Ecosim" software package to assess changes in benthic food web properties in the Mondego estuarine ecosystem (Portugal). Field, laboratory and literature information were used to construct the models. The main study objective was to assess at 2 sites (a Zostera meadow and a bare sediment area) the effects of: (1) a period of anthropogenic enrichment, which led to excessive production of organic matter in the form of algal blooms (1993/1994); (2) the implementation of mitigation measures, following a long period of eutrophication (1999/2000); and (3) a centenary flood (winter 2000/2001). Different numbers of compartments were identified at each site and in each time period. In general, the Zostera site, due to its complex community, showed a higher number of compartments and a higher level of system activity (i.e. sum of consumptions, respiration, flow to detritus, production, total system throughput, net primary production and system omnivory index). The differences at the two sites in the three time periods in the breakdown of throughput were mainly due to differences in the biomass of the primary producers (higher primary production at the Zostera site). Consumption, respiration and flow to detritus were dominated by the grazers Hydrobia ulvae and Scrobicularia plana at the Zostera and bare sediment sites respectively. At both sites, after recovery measures were implemented there was an increase in S. plana and Hediste diversicolor biomass, consumption, respiration and flows to detritus, and a decrease in H. ulvae biomass and associated flows, which increased again after the flood event. The mass-balanced models showed that the trophic structure of the benthic communities in Mondego estuary was affected differently by each disturbance event. Interestingly, in our study a high system throughput seems to be associated with higher stress levels, which contradicts the idea that higher system activity is always a sign of healthier conditions. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The causes of suicidal behaviour are not fully understood; however, this behaviour clearly results from the complex interaction of many factors. Although many risk factors have been identified, they mostly do not account for why people try to end their lives. In this Review, we describe key recent developments in theoretical, clinical, and empirical psychological science about the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and emphasise the central importance of psychological factors. Personality and individual differences, cognitive factors, social aspects, and negative life events are key contributors to suicidal behaviour. Most people struggling with suicidal thoughts and behaviours do not receive treatment. Some evidence suggests that different forms of cognitive and behavioural therapies can reduce the risk of suicide reattempt, but hardly any evidence about factors that protect against suicide is available. The development of innovative psychological and psychosocial treatments needs urgent attention.},

abstract = {Maternal effects arise when a mother's phenotype or the environment she experiences influences the phenotype of her progeny. Most studies of adaptive maternal effects are a "snapshot" of a mother's lifetime offspring provisioning and do not generally consider the effects of earlier siblings on those produced later. Here we show that in soil mites, offspring provisioning strategies are dynamic, changing from an emphasis on egg number in young females to egg size in older females. This pattern may be adaptive if it increases the survival of younger offspring that must compete with older, larger siblings. The dynamic shift in egg provisioning was greater in high-food environments in which females lived longer, creating increasing asymmetry in offspring competitive abilities. Females reared in isolation and in the presence of a high-density colony had identical provisioning strategies, suggesting that, unlike males in this species, females do not use pheromones to assess colony size. Our findings suggest that the adaptive significance of maternal effects may be misinterpreted when studies consider only a snapshot of a female's offspring provisioning strategy or when components of the offspring provisioning strategy are studied in isolation.},

abstract = {Abstract. 1. Atriplex canescens (Pursh) Nuttall and A.polycarpa (Torrey) Watson (Chenopodiaceae) support twelve morphologically distinct gall types in southern California. Thirty-seven common species of parasitoids, predators and inquilines are associated with these galls.2. The galls incited by eight members of the Asphondylia atriplicis Cockerell (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) species complex are linked into a single, interacting community through shared hymenopterous parasitoids and inquilines.3. Cluster analysis (UPGMA) grouped the fifteen most common species of Chalcidoidea into three host guilds of five species each: (1) specialists in tumour stem and blister leaf galls on A.canescens, (2) specialists in woolly stem galls on A.poiycarpa, and (3) generalists that attack all galls. Guild 1 dominated the galls with which it was primarily associated, while guild 3 dominated the remainder.4. The abundances of the parasitoids of the tumour stem and blister leaf galls were negatively correlated with the abundances of two organizer species, a gall-forming inquiline, Tetrastichus cecidobroter Gordh and Hawkins, and an internal, larval—pupal parasitoid, Tetrastichus sp. B. The abundances of nine of the twelve most common chalcidoids were not correlated with the abundances of all coaccurring species in six other galls.5. Host seasonality partly determines parasitoid population dynamics and guild structure. Parasitoid dominance increased with gall duration, suggesting that parasitoid competition depends on resource stability. The two continuously available galls were dominated by their specialist guild, while all seasonal galls were dominated by generalists. The subdominant specialists of woolly stem galls may represent competitively inferior species that utilize those galls opportunistically, because of the gall's widespread distribution and 9–10 month yearly availability.6. Sites in the Colorado Desert and chaparral that supported several gall types showed stable relative abundances of the major parasitoid species, whereas sites in the Mojave Desert that supported only woolly stem galls had unpredictable parasitoid species assemblages.7. The competitive success of Atriplex gall parasitoids may depend primarily on voltinism (multivoltine species dominated univoltine species) and mode of feeding (phytophagous, mixed entomophagous—phytophagous and facultatively hyperparasitic species in general dominated strict primary parasitoids).},

abstract = {1. Las lagunas costeras de Guerrero presentan un ciclo de fisiolog{\'{i}}a ambiental con tres periodos ecol{\'{o}}gicos anuales: Periodo 1 (normal, salinidades entre 15 y 34‰), agosto a noviembre, las lagunas se encuentran en contacto con el mar a trav{\'{e}}s de una boca en la barrera arenosa existiendo un intercambio biol{\'{o}}gico, f{\'{i}}sico y qu{\'{i}}mico. Periodo 2 (hipersalino, salinidades mayores de 35‰ noviembre a mayo, las lagunas se encuentran aisladas del mar y la evaporaci{\'{o}}n excede a los aportes de aguas dulces; m{\'{i}}nimo volumen de agua en las lagunas, Periodo 3 (hipo salino, salinidades menores de 15‰ mayo a agosto, las lagunas se encuentran aisladas del mar y los aportes de aguas dulces exceden a la tasa de evaporaci{\'{o}}n; m{\'{a}}ximo volumen de agua en las lagunas. 2. La vegetaci{\'{o}}n de las lagunas se compone de los siguientes elementos: a) palmar, b) lignetum pernnifolio de manglar, c) semiacu{\'{a}}tica, y d) acu{\'{a}}tica. Los principales productores primarios son los manglares y fitoplancton. 3. Seg{\'{u}}n estudios de otros autores la biomasa fitoplanct{\'{o}}nica es alta comparada con otros ecosistemas lagunares de M{\'{e}}xico. 4. Los grupos del zooplancton m{\'{a}}s comunes han sido cop{\'{e}}podos, quetognatos, larvas de gastr{\'{o}}podos, larvas de bivalvos, larvas de cirripedios, larvas de poliquetos, larvas de dec{\'{a}}podos, y algunas larvas y huevecillos de peces. Estudios de otros autores discuten la diversidad espec{\'{i}}fica y abundancia del zooplancton en las lagunas de Guerrero. 5. La macrofauna bent{\'{o}}nica tiene representantes de Porifera, Cnidaria, Annelida, Mollusca (bivalos y gastr{\'{o}}podos) en fondos blandos y duros, Arthropoda (Scalpellidae, Balanidae, Penaeidae, Palaemonidae, Callianasidae, Diogenidae, Coenobitidae, Portunidae, Xanthidae, Pinnotheridae, Grapsidae, Gecarcinidae, Ocypodidae, Isopoda y Tanaidacea) distribuidos en: a) facie de playa, b) facie de manglar, c) facie bent{\'{o}}nico pel{\'{a}}gico, y d) facie bent{\'{o}}nico de fondos arenosos y fangosos. En general el bentos est{\'{a}} pobremente representado y no caracteriza a las lagunas en particular. 6. Examinados 15 905 espec{\'{i}}menes de peces fueron determinados: 2 clases, 2 divisiones, 6 super{\'{o}}rdenes, 13 {\'{o}}rdenes, 22 sub{\'{o}}rdenes, 37 familias, 67 g{\'{e}}neros y 105 especies. Las familias mejor representadas en diversidad han sido Carangidae (11 especies), Sciaenidae (8), Gobidae (8), Gerridae (7), Urolophidae (6), Engraulidae (5), Poecilidae (5), y Pomadasyidae (4). 7. Zoogeogr{\'{a}}ficamente el sistema lagunar estudiado (37 familias, 67 g{\'{e}}neros y 105 especies) presenta una afinidad de "cero" especies con Canad{\'{a}}, 15{\%} con California, 31{\%}, con el Golfo de California, 45{\%} con Huizache-Caimanero Sinaloa, 48{\%}, con Agua Brava Nayarit, 60{\%} con el litoral de Guerrero, 67{\%} con el complejo tropical de Panam{\'{a}}-Colombia-Ecuador, 60{\%}, con el litoral de Per{\'{u}}, 47, con el litoral del norte de Chile, 16{\%} con las islas Gal{\'{a}}pagos, 15{\%} con la costa del Sur del Golfo de M{\'{e}}xico y el Caribe, 5{\%} con la ictiofauna continental de Sudam{\'{e}}rica, 2{\%} de especies introducidas y el 10{\%} son end{\'{e}}micas del Pac{\'{i}}fico de M{\'{e}}xico. Estos antecedentes refuerzan la hip{\'{o}}tesis que la ictiofauna costera del Pac{\'{i}}fico Oriental ha seguido ciertos patrones de radiaci{\'{o}}n limitados m{\'{a}}s bien por el avance en el grado de evoluci{\'{o}}n y adaptaci{\'{o}}n a las masas de aguas fr{\'{i}}o-temperadas, que por una capacidad de desplazamiento de los peces. 8. La diversidad var{\'{i}}a en el espacio y en el tiempo y muy pocas especies se encuentran presentes todo el a{\~{n}}o y a trav{\'{e}}s de todo el sistema lagunar, estas especies fueron 9 (8.5{\%}) y en n{\'{u}}mero de individuos 10 152 (64{\%}) de las colectas totales, i. e., Galeichthys caerulescens (3 396), Mugil curema (2 825), Diapterus peruvianus (1831), Lile stolifera (478), Dormitator latifrons (425) Mugil cephalus (402), Cichlasoma trimaculatum (384), Gerres cinereus (267) y Gobionellus microdon (145). 9. La din{\'{a}}mica ecol{\'{o}}gica del ambiente se refleja en la composici{\'{o}}n cuali y cuantitativa de las comunidades ictiofaun{\'{i}}sticas, las cuales, en todo el sistema lagunar, est{\'{a}}n constituidas por un 14{\%}, de peces dulceacu{\'{i}}colas, 6{\%} de peces marinos propiamente estuarinos, 28{\%} de peces marinos que utilizan el estuario como {\'{a}}reas de crianza, 31{\%} de peces marinos que utilizan el estuario como adultos y para alimentarse, y 21{\%} de peces marinos visitantes ocasionales de periodicidad ac{\'{i}}clica. Esta proporci{\'{o}}n var{\'{i}}a en las diferentes lagunas en su composici{\'{o}}n y abundancia relativa de especies de acuerdo a: a) las condiciones hidrol{\'{o}}gicas del sistema ecol{\'{o}}gico, consecuencia de b) la {\'{e}}poca del a{\~{n}}o y el per{\'{i}}odo ecol{\'{o}}gico de las lagunas, c) la localidad dentro del estuario y sus gradientes de salinidades, y d) la disponibilidad del alimento. 10. Examinados cuantitativamente 2 372 est{\'{o}}magos de los peces de importancia comercial (i. e., Elops affinis, Galeichthys caerulescens, Centropomus robalito, C. nigrescens, Caranx hippos, Lutjanus argentiventris, L. novemfasciatus, Gerres cinereus, Eugerres lineatus, Diapterus peruvianus, Mugil curema, Cichlasoma trimaculatum y Dormitator latifrons) y determinada cualitativamente la alimentaci{\'{o}}n del resto de la fauna ictiol{\'{o}}gica, se concluye que dentro de la trama tr{\'{o}}fica de los ecosistemas lagunares existen 3 categor{\'{i}}as ictiotr{\'{o}}ficas. 11. Las 3 categor{\'{i}}as ictiotr{\'{o}}ficas corresponden a: I. Consumidores Primarios donde se incluye a los peces a) Planct{\'{o}}fagos - fito y/o zooplanct{\'{o}}fagos-, b) Detrit{\'{i}}voros, y c) Omn{\'{i}}voros que se alimentan de peque{\~{n}}os organismos animales, detritus y vegetales. 2. Consumidores Secundarios donde se incluye a los peces predominantemente carn{\'{i}}voros que eventualmente pueden incorporar en su dieta algunos vegetales y detritus pero sin mucha significaci{\'{o}}n cuantitativa. 3. Consumidores de Tercer Orden donde se incluye a los peces exclusivamente carn{\'{i}}voros donde los vegetales y el detritus son un alimento accidental. 12. El espectro tr{\'{o}}fico de los peces puede sufrir modificaciones, dentro de un patr{\'{o}}n general, debido a: a) la disponibilidad del alimento, b) la edad del pez, c) la {\'{e}}poca del a{\~{n}}o y el periodo ecol{\'{o}}gico en que se encuentra la laguna, y d) el {\'{a}}rea particular dentro de la laguna. 13. Por afinidad ecol{\'{o}}gica las lagunas pueden ser reunidas en dos tipos. Grupo A en las cuales el ciclo de fisiolog{\'{i}}a ambiental afecta a toda la laguna, profundidades medias de 1 m, temperaturas de 29 a 35° C, salinidades de 2 a 125‰ alta biomasa fitoplanct{\'{o}}nica, variable cantidad de detritus, pocos manglares, variable biomasa macrobent{\'{o}}nica, estructura tr{\'{o}}fica y comunidades nect{\'{o}}nicas complejas en diversidad durante el periodo 1 simplific{\'{a}}ndose durante los periodos 2 y 3; s{\'{o}}lo un 15{\%} de peces presentes durante todo el a{\~{n}}o demuestra lo inestable del ambiente. Grupo B en las cuales el ciclo afecta s{\'{o}}lo una parte limitada de las lagunas, profundidades medias de 2 m, temperaturas de 29 a 33°C, salinidades de 0 a 4‰, muy alta biomasa fitoplanct{\'{o}}nica, grandes cantidades de detritus, numerosos manglares, casi ausencia de biomasa macrobent{\'{o}}nica, estructura tr{\'{o}}fica y comunidades nect{\'{o}}nicas de complejidad relativa durante el periodo 1 en la zona de influencia. marina y simples en el resto de la laguna durante ese periodo, as{\'{i}} como tambi{\'{e}}n en toda la superficie lagunar durante los periodos 2 y 3; un 55{\%} de peces presentes durante todo el a{\~{n}}o demuestra lo estable del ambiente. 14. Los manglares son los productores primarios m{\'{a}}s importantes en ambos grupos de lagunas, agregando adem{\'{a}}s al fitoplancton en las lagunas del Grupo B. A partir de ellos existen al menos cuatro v{\'{i}}as del flujo energ{\'{e}}tico hacia los heter{\'{o}}trofos: 1. Hojas de manglar y fitoplancton que proveen sustancias org{\'{a}}nicas disueltas --{\textgreater} microorganismos --{\textgreater} consumidores. 2. Sustancias org{\'{a}}nicas disueltas --{\textgreater} absorci{\'{o}}n por sedimentos y por detritus particulado ya existente --{\textgreater} consumidores. 3. Hojas y restos de hojas --{\textgreater} consumidores, 4. Hojas y restos de hojas --{\textgreater} bacterias y hongos --{\textgreater} consumidores. Esta {\'{u}}ltima es la m{\'{a}}s importante. 15. La diversidad ictiofaun{\'{i}}stica, la productividad pesquera de las lagunas, y la complejidad de la trama tr{\'{o}}fica, est{\'{a}}n en relaci{\'{o}}n directa con la influencia marina que reciben las lagunas durante el periodo 1. En las lagunas del Grupo A, durante el Periodo 1. La diversidad puede llegar a 70 especies, la densidad es de 12 ejem./19.5 m² y el "standing crop" de 66.7 g/m²; durante el periodo 2 la diversidad es de 18 especies, la densidad es de 8 ejem./m² y el "standing crop" de 44.3 g/m²; durante el periodo 3 la diversidad es de 22 especies, la densidad es de 7 ejem./19.5 m² y el "standing crop" de 38.8 g/m². En las lagunas del Grupo B, durante el periodo 1, la diversidad puede llegar a 26 especies, la densidad es de 14 ejem./19.5 m² y el "standing crop" de 43.1 g/m²; durante el periodo 2 la diversidad es de 19 especies la densidad es de 7 ejem./19.5 m² y el "standing crop" de 21.5 g/m²; durante el periodo 3 la diversidad es de 26 especies, la densidad es de 8 ejem./19.5 m² y el "standing crop" de 24.6 g/m². Las condiciones de salinidad determinan un reemplazo de especies dentro de los diferentes niveles tr{\'{o}}ficos, tanto intra como inter lagunar. 16. La diversidad ictiofaun{\'{i}}stica, en t{\'{e}}rminos de n{\'{u}}mero de especies (riqueza o variabilidad) y de {\'{i}}ndice (H'), est{\'{a}} regulada principalmente por los siguientes factores: 1. variedad de nichos, 2. tama{\~{n}}o o sobreposici{\'{o}}n de los nichos, 3. estabilidad del medioambiente, 4. rigurosidad del medioambiente, 5. sucesi{\'{o}}n, 6. productividad, 7. acumulaci{\'{o}}n de biomasa, 8. competencia, 9. espacio, 10. tama{\~{n}}o de los organismos, y 11. longitud de las cadenas alimenticias. Estos factores tienen un efecto particular en el medioambiente lagunar estuarino y se discuten en detalle. 17. El corolario ecol{\'{o}}gico es que, en los estuarios y lagunas costeras, los peces transforman energ{\'{i}}a desde fuentes primarias, conducen energ{\'{i}}a activamente a trav{\'{e}}s de la trama tr{\'{o}}fica, intercambian energ{\'{i}}a con ecosistemas vecinos a trav{\'{e}}s de importaci{\'{o}}n y exportaci{\'{o}}n de ella, representan una forma de almacenamiento de energ{\'{i}}a dentro del ecosistema y, finalmente, constituyen un agente de regulac},

abstract = {A network model of trophic interactions in a tropical reservoir in India was developed with the objective to quantify matter and energy flows between system components and to study the impact of invasive fishes on the ecosystem. Structure of flows and their distribution within and between trophic levels were analysed by aggregating single flows into combined flows for discrete trophic levels. The trophic flows primarily occurred in the first four trophic level (TL) and the food web structure in this reservoir ecosystem was characterized by the dominance of low TL organisms, with the highest TL of only 3.57 for the top predator. Highest system omnivory index (SOI) was observed for indigenous catfishes (0.422), followed by the exotic fish Mozambique Tilapia (0.402). Nile Tilapia and Pearl spots show the highest niche overlap which suggests high competition for similar resources. The mixed trophic impact routine reveals that an increase in the abundance of the African catfish would negatively impact almost all fish groups such as Indian major carps, Pearl spots, indigenous catfishes and Tilapines. The other invasive fish Mozambique Tilapia adversely affects the indigenous catfishes. The most interesting observation in this study is that the most dominant invasive fish in this reservoir, the Nile Tilapia does not negatively impact any of the fish groups. In fact it positively impacts the Indian major carps. The direct and indirect effects of predation between system components (i.e. fish, invertebrates, phytoplankton and detritus) are quantitatively described and the possible influence and role in the ecosystem's functioning of the invasive fish species are discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We generated a mass-balance model to figure out the food web structure and trophic interactions of the major functional groups of the Ethiopian highland Lake Hayq. Moreover, the study lay down a baseline data for future ecosystem-based investigations and management activities. Extensive data collection has been taken place between October 2007 and May 2009. Ecotrophic efficiency (EE) of several functional groups including phytoplankton (0.8) and detritus (0.85) was high indicating the utilization of the groups within the system. However, the EE of Mesocyclops (0.03) and Thermocyclops (0.30) was very low implying these resources were rather a 'sink' in the trophic hierarchy. Flows based on aggregated trophic level sensu Lindeman revealed the importance of both phytoplankton and detritus to higher trophic levels. The computed average transfer efficiency of 11.5{\%} for the first four trophic levels was within the range for highly efficient African lakes. The primary production to respiration (P/. R) ratio (1.05) of Lake Hayq indicates the maturity of the ecosystem. We also modeled the food-web by excluding Tilapia and reduced phytoplankton biomass to get insight into the mass balance before Tilapia was introduced. The analysis resulted in a lower system omnivory index (SOI. = 0.016) and a reduced P/. R ratio (0.13) that described the lake as immature ecosystem, suggesting the introduction of Tilapia might have contributed to the maturity of the lake. Tilapia in Lake Hayq filled an ecological empty niche of pelagic planktivores, and contributed for the better transfer efficiency observed from primary production to fish yield. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This chapter emphasizes the ecological responses of fishes to spatial and temporal variation in tropical stream habitats. It also discusses the steps to alleviate human impacts and restore degraded streams to protect the species of the fish. It reveals that freshwater fishes comprise 25{\%} of the vertebrate species on earth. The South and Central American rivers and streams contain the greatest number of species on Earth, with recent estimates ranging as high as 8000 and 25{\%} of global fish species richness. The highest fish species richness in the Neotropics is within the Amazon Basin. The ultimate environmental driver for variations in habitat quality and quantity, and hence breeding events, is probably stream hydrology. Tropical stream fishes occupy almost the entire spectrum of trophic niches that can occur in aquatic communities. Aquatic invertebrates are important food sources for stream fishes throughout the tropics. Terrestrial plants tissues, especially flowers, fruits, and seeds are very important resources for fishes in tropical streams. The primary threat to the ecological integrity of tropical streams and the long. -term survival of their fish faunas is degradation of watersheds by a variety of human activities. The largest impact is from deforestation and conversion of land to agriculture besides over-fishing, dam construction, use of pesticides and herbicides, and introductions of exotic species, etc. Protection of vegetation cover, maintenance of the integrity of riparian zones, and reductions in point. - and non. -point. -source pollution are essential components of conservation and management strategies for stream fishes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Resolving current concerns about the role of biodiversity on ecosystems calls for understanding the separate roles of changes in species numbers and of composition. Recent work shows that primary productivity often, but not always, saturates with species richness within single trophic levels. However, any interpretation of such patterns must consider that variation in biodiversity is necessarily associated with changes in species composition (identity), and that changes in biodiversity often occur across multiple trophic levels. Here we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we independently manipulated species richness and species composition across multiple trophic levels in pond food webs. In contrast to previous studies that focused on single trophic levels, we found that productivity is either idiosyncratic or increases with respect to species richness, and that richness influences trophic structure. However, the composition of species within richness levels can have equally or more marked effects on ecosystems than average effects of richness per se. Indirect evidence suggests that richness and associated changes in species composition affect ecosystem attributes through indirect effects and trophic interactions among species, features that are highly characteristic of natural, complex ecosystems.},

Spatial coexistence mechanisms are partitioned into three types: the storage effect, nonlinear competitive variance, and growth- density covariance. We first describe how the strength of each of these mechanisms depends on covariances between population den- sities and between population densities and the environment, and we then explain how changes in the scales of dispersal, competition, and environmental heterogeneity should affect these covariances.Our quantitative approach allows us to show how changes in the scales of biological and physical processes can shift the relative importance of different classes of spatial coexistence mechanisms and gives us a more complete understanding of how environmental heterogeneity can enable coexistence. For example, we show how environmental heterogeneity can promote coexistence even when competing species have identical responses to the environment. Keywords:},

Also two predator-prey interactions per species across all values of S is predicted (i.e. L/S is constant across values of S) 2. constant connectance: constant connectance C (=L/S{\^{}}2, L=observed links, S=possible links) and consequently an increasing number of predator-prey interactions with increasing number of species (S) (i.e. L/S increases with S) 3. species packing: average number of predator-prey interactions reduces with increasing number of species (i.e. L/S decreases with S)  Six independent datasets allow serious testing of number of species with C and diet breadth (relative importance of different food sources as determined from gut contents).   The relationships with species richness and mean diet breadth of the six cases show contrasting results. One case weakly support constant connectance, one support sprecies packing and four support none of the three theories. Taking a closer look at the fits, they conclude that in fact no theory is supported by the examples. Why?   In four of the 6 cases the L/S relations vary widely across S values and only two significant linear relations could be observed. The slope was both positive and as such support the constant connectance theory, but the number of link per consumer is uniformely underestimated. Aside from this, all L/S values greetly exceed the value of 2 as predicted by the link-species scaling law. The species packing rule is not supported.  The lack of congruence between theory and field data is probably the result of intersite and temporal variability.},

abstract = {Food resource use by seven cyprinids from an Iberian stream was analysed over 9 months. Differences in food resource use were found both between species and within species between seasons. Plant material was a more important food for carp, nase, goldfish and barbel than for gudgeon, roach and chub, irrespective of the season. Chironomid larvae were the staple animal food for the former five species throughout the year. Roach and chub, especially the latter, displayed large seasonal variations in prey use, with chironomid larvae only being important during autumn. Ephemerellid nymphs and ephemeropteran images dominated the animal diet of chub during spring and summer, respectively. Dipteran adults and Formicidae were the most important prey for roach during spring and summer, with other common prey being ephemerellid nymphs and hydropsychid larvae. Food resource overlap among the three dominant species (roach, barbel and chub) displayed a large seasonal variation. High overlaps were observed during autumn when these species used the same resources. During summer overlaps were much lower with each species specialising on different prey. The remaining less abundant species had large diet overlaps amongst themselves and with barbel, over all seasons. It is suggested that morphological constraints, habitat partitioning and temporal changes in food resource limitation may be involved in producing these patterns of food resource use.},

abstract = {A component of metabolic scaling theory has worked towards understanding the influence of metabolism over the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Specific models within this 'metabolic theory of biodiversity' (MTB) have addressed temperature gradients in speciation rate and species richness, but the scope of MTB has been questioned because of empirical departures from model predictions. In this study, we first show that a generalized MTB is not inconsistent with empirical patterns and subsequently implement an eco-evolutionary MTB which has thus far only been discussed qualitatively. More specifically, we combine a functional trait (body mass) approach and an environmental gradient (temperature) with a dynamic eco-evolutionary model that builds on the current MTB. Our approach uniquely accounts for feedbacks between ecological interactions (size-dependent competition and predation) and evolutionary rates (speciation and extinction). We investigate a simple example in which temperature influences mutation rate, and show that this single effect leads to dynamic temperature gradients in macroevolutionary rates and community structure. Early in community evolution, temperature strongly influences speciation and both speciation and extinction strongly influence species richness. Through time, niche structure evolves, speciation and extinction rates fall, and species richness becomes increasingly independent of temperature. However, significant temperature-richness gradients may persist within emergent functional (trophic) groups, especially when niche breadths are wide. Thus, there is a strong signal of both history and ecological interactions on patterns of species richness across temperature gradients. More generally, the successful implementation of an eco-evolutionary MTB opens the perspective that a process-based MTB can continue to emerge through further development of metabolic models that are explicit in terms of functional traits and environmental gradients.},

The spatial and temporal distributions of ocean NPP are consistent with primary limitation by light, nutrients, and temperature. On land, water limitation imposes additional constraints.

abstract = {For numerous taxa, species richness is much higher in tropical than in temperate zone habitats. A major challenge in community ecology and evolutionary biogeography is to reveal the mechanisms underlying these differences. For herbivorous insects, one such mechanism leading to an increased number of species in a given locale could be increased ecological specialization, resulting in a greater proportion of insect species occupying narrow niches within a community. We tested this hypothesis by comparing host specialization in larval Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) at eight different New World forest sites ranging in latitude from 15 degrees S to 55 degrees N. Here we show that larval diets of tropical Lepidoptera are more specialized than those of their temperate forest counterparts: tropical species on average feed on fewer plant species, genera and families than do temperate caterpillars. This result holds true whether calculated per lepidopteran family or for a caterpillar assemblage as a whole. As a result, there is greater turnover in caterpillar species composition (greater beta diversity) between tree species in tropical faunas than in temperate faunas. We suggest that greater specialization in tropical faunas is the result of differences in trophic interactions; for example, there are more distinct plant secondary chemical profiles from one tree species to the next in tropical forests than in temperate forests as well as more diverse and chronic pressures from natural enemy communities.},

To assess the relationship between environmental characteristics and metabolic rate in birds, we collated BMR measurements for 92 populations representing 90 wild-caught species and examined the relationships between BMR and NPP, Ta, annual temperature range (Tr), precipitation and intra-annual coefficient of variation of precipitation (PCV). Using conventional non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic generalized least-squares approaches, we found no support for a relationship between BMR and NPP, despite including species captured throughout the world in environments spanning a 35-fold range in NPP. Instead, BMR was negatively associated with Ta and Tr, and positively associated with PCV.},

abstract = {--For almost three decades, structural habitat complexity has been regarded as a primary ecological factor responsible for maintaining high species diversity of trop-ical bird communities. However, differences in habitat complexity between temperate and tropical forests have not been documented sufficiently. Differences between tem-perate and tropical forests were quantified by measuring 36 variables related to under-story habitat structure. Structural components of temperate and tropical habitats differed significantly in several features. However, no differences were found in overall habitat heterogeneity (i.e. complexity) between temperate and tropical forests. To search for "bird-related" factors important in maintaining high tropical species diversity, we com-pared habitat selection between foliage-gleaning insectivorous birds in temperate and tropical forest understories. The tropical species were more specialized in horizontal and vertical habitat selection, and had lower "niche breadths" in foraging substrate and in foraging height. Tropical species also showed less interspecific overlap in most foraging variables than did temperate species. Therefore, higher species diversity, at least within this guild of birds in tropical and temperate forest understories, can be attributed at the proximate level to greater specialization and "tighter species packing," and may be more independent of greater habitat complexity than previously thought.

Sin embargo, no encontramos diferencias en la hetero-geneidad del habitat (complejidad) entre bosques templados y tropicales. Buscando fac-tores que rueran importantes en mantenet la alta diversidad de las especies de pajaros tropicales, comparamos la seleccion del habitat entre pajaros insectivoros que usan el follaje bajo el dosel en bosques templados y tropicales. Las especies tropicales estaban mas especializadas en su seleccion de habitats al nivel horizontal y vertical, teniendo pequenos nichos en el substrato y altitud del area donde forrajeaban. En la mayoria de las variables relacionadas al forraje, las especies tropicales tambien demonstraron menos traslapo entre-especies que las especies templadas. Concluimos pues que la alta variedad de especies, pot lo menos dentro de este grupo de pajaros que viven bajo el dosel en bosques templados y tropicales, se puede atribuir inicialmente a mayor especializacion y concentracion de especies y puede que sea mas independiente de la total complejidad del habitat de lo que actualmente se cree.},

abstract = {Broad-scale variation in taxonomic richness is strongly correlated with climate. Many mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain these patterns; however, testable predictions that would distinguish among them have rarely been derived. Here, we examine several prominent hypotheses for climate–richness relationships, deriving and testing predictions based on their hypothesized mechanisms. The ?energy–richness hypothesis? (also called the ?more individuals hypothesis? ) postulates that more productive areas have more individuals and therefore more species. More productive areas do often have more species, but extant data are not consistent with the expected causal relationship from energy to numbers of individuals to numbers of species. We reject the energy–richness hypothesis in its standard form and consider some proposed modifications. The ?physiological tolerance hypothesis? postulates that richness varies according to the tolerances of individual species for different sets of climatic conditions. This hypothesis predicts that more combinations of physiological parameters can survive under warm and wet than cold or dry conditions. Data are qualitatively consistent with this prediction, but are inconsistent with the prediction that species should fill climatically suitable areas. Finally, the ?speciation rate hypothesis? postulates that speciation rates should vary with climate, due either to faster evolutionary rates or stronger biotic interactions increasing the opportunity for evolutionary diversification in some regions. The biotic interactions mechanism also has the potential to amplify shallower, underlying gradients in richness. Tests of speciation rate hypotheses are few (to date), and their results are mixed.},

abstract = {Climate change disrupts ecological systems in many ways. Many documented responses depend on species' life histories, contributing to the view that climate change effects are important but difficult to characterize generally. However, systematic variation in metabolic effects of temperature across trophic levels suggests that warming may lead to predictable shifts in food web structure and productivity. We experimentally tested the effects of warming on food web structure and productivity under two resource supply scenarios. Consistent with predictions based on universal metabolic responses to temperature, we found that warming strengthened consumer control of primary production when resources were augmented. Warming shifted food web structure and reduced total biomass despite increases in primary productivity in a marine food web. In contrast, at lower resource levels, food web production was constrained at all temperatures. These results demonstrate that small temperature changes could dramatically shift food web dynamics and provide a general, species-independent mechanism for ecological response to environmental temperature change.},

Because of their overall complexity, an intriguing approach to understanding network structure is by breaking it down into the structural roles of its constituent species. The structural role of a species can be directly measured based on how it appears in network motifs - the basic building blocks of complex networks. Here, we study the distribution of species' roles at three distinct spatio-temporal scales (i.e. species, network, and temporal) in host-parasitoid networks collected across 22 sites over two years within a fragmented landscape of oaks in southern Finland. We found that species' roles for hosts and parasitoids were heterogeneously distributed across the study system but that roles are strongly conserved over spatial scales. In addition, we found that species' roles were remarkably consistent between years even in the presence of disturbances (e.g. species turnover). Overall, our results suggest that species' roles are an intrinsic property of species that may be predictable over spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {Previous analyses of empirical food webs (the networks of who eats whom in a community) have revealed that parasites exert a strong influence over observed food web structure and alter many network properties such as connectance and degree distributions. It remains unclear, however, whether these community-level effects are fully explained by differences in the ways that parasites and free-living species interact within a food web. To rigorously quantify the interrelationship between food web structure, the types of species in a web and the distinct types of feeding links between them, we introduce a shared methodology to quantify the structural roles of both species and feeding links. Roles are quantified based on the frequencies with which a species (or link) appears in different food web motifs - the building blocks of networks. We hypothesized that different types of species (e.g. top predators, basal resources, parasites) and different types of links between species (e.g. classic predation, parasitism, concomitant predation on parasites along with their hosts) will show characteristic differences in their food web roles. We found that parasites do indeed have unique structural roles in food webs. Moreover, we demonstrate that different types of feeding links (e.g. parasitism, predation or concomitant predation) are distributed differently in a food web context. More than any other interaction type, concomitant predation appears to constrain the roles of parasites. In contrast, concomitant predation links themselves have more variable roles than any other type of interaction. Together, our results provide a novel perspective on how both species and feeding link composition shape the structure of an ecological community and vice versa.},

abstract = {Traditionally, the niche of a species is described as a hypothetical 3D space, constituted by well-known biotic interactions (e.g. predation, competition, trophic relationships, resource–consumer interactions, etc.) and various abiotic environmental factors. Species distribution models (SDMs), also called “niche models” and often used to predict wildlife distribution at landscape scale, are typically constructed using abiotic factors with biotic interactions generally been ignored. Here, we compared the goodness of fit of SDMs for red-backed shrike Lanius collurio in farmlands of Western Poland, using both the classical approach (modeled only on environmental variables) and the approach which included also other potentially associated bird species. The potential associations among species were derived from the relevant ecological literature and by a correlation matrix of occurrences. Our findings highlight the importance of including heterospecific interactions in improving our understanding of niche occupation for bird species. We suggest that suite of measures currently used to quantify realized species niches could be improved by also considering the occurrence of certain associated species. Then, an hypothetical “species 1” can use the occurrence of a successfully established individual of “species 2” as indicator or “trace” of the location of available suitable habitat to breed. We hypothesize this kind of biotic interaction as the “heterospecific trace effect” (HTE): an interaction based on the availability and use of “public information” provided by individuals from different species. Finally, we discuss about the incomes of biotic interactions for enhancing the predictive capacities on species distribution models.},

abstract = {* The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. * The presentation of ‘variance explained' (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. * One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). * Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. * This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

abstract = {There is increasing world-wide concern about the impact of the introduction of exotic species on ecological communities. Since many exotic plants depend on native pollinators to successfully establish, it is of paramount importance that we understand precisely how exotic species integrate into existing plant-pollinator communities. In this manuscript, we have studied a global data base of empirical pollination networks to determine whether community, network, species or interaction characteristics can help identify invaded communities. We found that a limited number of community and network properties showed significant differences among the empirical data sets - namely networks with exotic plants present are characterized by greater total, plant and pollinator richness, as well as higher values of relative nestedness. We also observed significant differences in terms of the pollinators that interact with the exotic plants. In particular, we found that specialist pollinators that are also weak contributors to community nestedness are far more likely to interact with exotic plants than would be expected by chance alone. By virtue of their interactions, it appears that exotic plants may provide a key service to a community's specialist pollinators as well as fill otherwise vacant 'coevolutionary niches'.},

Human beings of all races and cultures appear to have been predominantly right-handed since the earliest records were made. The time when right-handedness emerged in human evolution is a matter of some dispute. Because of poor record-keeping in prehistoric times, statements about the evolution of laterality in human beings must be based largely on speculation. The present review summarizes the prehistoric data concerning handedness and cerebral laterality. It is confirmed that laterality is not evolved in the last thousand years but it seems that lateralization of functions is the result of a protracted process elapsing perhaps several million years ago. Moreover this paper discusses the genesis and reasons of laterality.},

Here, angiosperm divergence times are estimated using non-parametric rate smoothing and a three-gene dataset covering ca. 75{\%} of all angiosperm families recognized in recent classifications. The results provide an initial hypothesis of angiosperm diversification times. Using an internal calibration point, an independent evaluation of angiosperm and eudicot origins is performed. The origin of the crown group of extant angiosperms is indicated to be Early to Middle Jurassic (179-158 Myr), and the origin of eudicots is resolved as Late Jurassic to mid Cretaceous (147-131 Myr). Both estimates, despite a conservative calibration point, are older than current fossil-based estimates.},

abstract = {There is an increased interest in phylogenetic approaches for conservation biology and community analysis. Many of these analyses are carried out using the Phylocom 4.2 package. With this computational tool, already existing trees are pruned to species from community to be studied. For plant communities, a variety of megatrees including all angiosperm families are available for phylogenetic community analysis. Using the bladj algorithm, internal nodes of community trees derived from these megatrees are calibrated on time scales from fossil or molecular data provided in an ages file. The higher precision of tree calibration, the better is the ecological interpretation if we assume that the closest related species have the most superposed set of traits, the highest probability of co-occurrence in case of environmental filter effects and the highest ratio of competitive exclusion. Together with the Phylocom 4.2 package comes an ages file based on Wikstrom's dating of angiosperm families (wikstrom.ages). But there are inconsistencies in syntax and/or nomenclature between internal node names of trees and the ages file from phylocom that influence the tree calibration and the subsequent analysis. To avoid that, we classified all online available megatrees according to their syntax and nomenclatureof internal nodes. For each of the four classes we provide a new, fully compatible ages file in the supplement material. Each online available megatree, pruned to the species from an example community from the Atlantic Rainforest, was calibrated twice running the bladj algorithm using once the original wikstrom.ages file and, additionally, the new ages file prepared for that tree class. Outcomes from trees calibrated by different methods have been compared. To avoid inconsistencies that push results beyond the realistic, we recommend a strict application of the four ages files provided as supplementary files. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic diversity-area curves are analogous to species-area curves and quantify the relationship between the phylogenetic diversity of species assemblages and the area over which assemblages are sampled. Here, we developed theoretical expectations of these curves under different ecological and macroevolutionary processes. We first used simulations to generate curves expected under three ecological community assembly processes: species sorting, where species have distinct environmental preferences; random placement, where species have no environmental preference but vary in their prevalence across communities; and limited dispersal, where species have no environmental preference but vary in their ability to disperse. Second, we simulated curves expected across regions (e.g., across oceanic islands) that are derived from colonization among regions, within-region speciation, and extinction. We also computed curves for two data sets, one on forest plots along an elevation gradient and the other on Caribbean island Anolis lizards. Of the three ecological processes, only species sorting produced strong relationships between phylogenetic diversity and area. The forest plot curves matched the species-sorting expectation, but only when phylogenetic repulsion (that caused closely related species to be found in similar habitats but not in the same plots) was also included in the simulation. Strong relationships between regional phylogenetic diversity and area were simulated if species were derived only from within-region speciation; colonizations among regions obscured the pattern. Similarly, larger Caribbean islands had more within-island speciation and contained more Anolis phylogenetic diversity than smaller islands, but colonizations among islands obscured this relationship. This work furthers our understanding of the processes that govern the phylogenetic diversity of ecological communities and biogeographic regions.},

abstract = {Random graphs with prescribed degree sequences have been widely used as a model of complex networks. Comparing an observed network to an ensemble of such graphs allows one to detect deviations from randomness in network properties. Here we briefly review two existing methods for the generation of random graphs with arbitrary degree sequences, which we call the ``switching'' and ``matching'' methods, and present a new method based on the ``go with the winners'' Monte Carlo method. The matching method may suffer from nonuniform sampling, while the switching method has no general theoretical bound on its mixing time. The ``go with the winners'' method has neither of these drawbacks, but is slow. It can however be used to evaluate the reliability of the other two methods and, by doing this, we demonstrate that the deviations of the switching and matching algorithms under realistic conditions are small compared to the ``go with the winners'' algorithm. Because of its combination of speed and accuracy we recommend the use of the switching method for most calculations.},

@article{Chamberlain2014,
abstract = {Interaction webs, or networks, define how the members of two or more trophic levels interact. However, the traits that mediate network structure have not been widely investigated. Generally, the mechanism that determines plant-pollinator partnerships is thought to involve the matching of a suite of species traits (such as abundance, phenology, morphology) between trophic levels. These traits are often unknown or hard to measure, but may reflect phylogenetic history. We asked whether morphological traits or phylogenetic history were more important in mediating network structure in mutualistic plant-pollinator interaction networks from Western Canada. At the plant species level, sexual system, growth form, and flower symmetry were the most important traits. For example species with radially symmetrical flowers had more connections within their modules (a subset of species that interact more among one another than outside of the module) than species with bilaterally symmetrical flowers. At the pollinator species level, social species had more connections within and among modules. In addition, larger pollinators tended to be more specialized. As traits mediate interactions and have a phylogenetic signal, we found that phylogenetically close species tend to interact with a similar set of species. At the network level, patterns were weak, but we found increasing functional trait and phylogenetic diversity of plants associated with increased weighted nestedness. These results provide evidence that both specific traits and phylogenetic history can contribute to the nature of mutualistic interactions within networks, but they explain less variation between networks.},

@article{Blomberg2003,
abstract = {The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92{\%} of traits exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25{\%} of traits) and/or ACDC (40{\%}) transformation parameter differed significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

Here, we study the distribution of species' roles at three distinct spatio-temporal scales (i.e. species, network, and temporal) in host-parasitoid networks collected across 22 sites over two years within a fragmented landscape of oaks in southern Finland. We found that species' roles for hosts and parasitoids were heterogeneously distributed across the study system but that roles are strongly conserved over spatial scales. In addition, we found that species' roles were remarkably consistent between years even in the presence of disturbances (e.g. species turnover). Overall, our results suggest that species' roles are an intrinsic property of species that may be predictable over spatial and temporal scales.},

Here, employing simple and general empirical arguments concerning the nature of movement, trophic position and behaviour we outline a general theory concerning the role of space and food web structure on food web stability. We argue that consumers link food webs in space and that this spatial structure combined with relatively rapid behavioural responses by consumers can strongly influence the dynamics of food webs. Employing simple spatially implicit food web models, we show that large mobile consumers are inordinately important in determining the stability, or lack of it, in ecosystems. More specifically, this theory suggests that mobile higher order organisms are potent stabilizers when embedded in a variable, and expansive spatial structure. However, when space is compressed and higher order consumers strongly couple local habitats then mobile consumers can have an inordinate destabilizing effect. Preliminary empirical arguments show consistency with this general theory.},

abstract = {All ecologists are familiar with graphical portrayals of food webs such as that shown in Figure 29.1a—tinkertoy constructions of nodes (e.g., species) connected by lines (feeding relations). This depiction of food webs (or, more formally, its matrix equivalent) has without question helped articulate many important questions in community ecology (e.g., Pimm (1982), Pimm et al. (1991), and Cohen et al (1990)). Yet, as with any powerful conceptual schemata in science, this characterization of community organization both liberates—organizing one's thoughts in fruitful directions—and enslaves—subtly constraining the questions one tends to ask. In particular, most descriptions of, and models about, food web structure make no explicit reference to space. But all ecological interactions, including trophic relations, are necessarily played out in a spatial arena. For some purposes this observation may well be irrelevant. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the resolution of many classical problems in community ecology, from the coexistence of competitors (e.g., Hanski (1983)), to the stabilization of predator-prey interactions (e.g. Hassell et al. (1991), to the interpretation of species richness patterns (Cornell and Lawton, 1992), requires a consideration of spatial dynamics. Food web ecology, too, should profit from an explicit incorporation of spatial perspectives.},

abstract = {Predation by fish (roach, Hesperoleucas symmetricus, and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss) produced strong cascading effects on biota associated with boulder-bedrock substrates in pools of a northern California [USA] river, but not on gravel-dwelling biota. Enclosure-exclosure experiments in the South Fork Eel River of northern California (39.degree.44'N, 123.degree.39'W) showed that fish, by suppressing densities of damselfly nymphs and other small predators, released algivorous chironomids (Pseudochironomus richardsoni) from predation. Chironomids in turn dramatically reduced algal standing crops. In contrast, fish had little effect on algae or invertebrates associated with gravel. Gravel-dwelling heptageniid mayflies were behaviorally inhibited from using tops of stones in fish enclosures, and stone surfaces had more chironomid tubes in fish enclosures than in fish exclosures. However, no effects on epilithic algae or densities of invertebrates comparable to those of biota on boulder-bedrock substrates were detected. These spatially varying predator effects in a river parallel results from marine benthic systems, where strong effects of large predators documented for rocky intertidal habitats and unvegetated soft bottoms are not conspicuous in seagrass beds.},

abstract = {Why is the World green - what keeps herbivores, and herbivorous insects in particular, from consuming all of their food? When this question was first posed, the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects was hotly disputed. While modern ecologists may agree that impacts from several different directions will affect local insect densities, the bottom-up vs top-down jargon seems to be stuck in a unidimensional world. Here, we argue that the strength of almost every bottom-up and top-down force is likely to vary in space, and that in itself, spatial structure invokes new processes which defy classification in the traditional bottom-up top-down scheme. To understand the relative importance of different forces keeping herbivore numbers in check, we feel that we need a fresh synthesis between the novel paradigm of spatial ecology and the classical paradigms of top-down and bottom-up studies. This synthesis requires a consideration of forces beyond the standard framework of top-down vs bottom-up effects, and should be based on comparing the relative strength of such forces at several sites in a spatially explicit framework. Overall, we should switch our focus from whether the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up factors vary in space to why there is variation, how much variation there is, and at what spatial scale(s) it occurs.},

Yet experiments are done on much shorter timescales, and the relevant timescales for ecological systems can also be relatively short. Thus, there is a mismatch between the timescales of most experiments and the timescales of many theoretical investigations. However, recent work has emphasized the importance of transient dynamics rather than long-term behavior in ecological systems, enabling the examination of forces that allow coexistence on ecological timescales. Through an examination of what leads to transients in ecological systems, a deeper appreciation of the forces leading to persistence or coexistence in ecological systems emerges, as well as a general understanding of how population levels can change through time.},

abstract = {We employed a combination of factorial experiments in the field and laboratory to investigate the relative magnitude and degree of interaction of bottom-up factors (two levels each of host-plant nutrition and vegetation complexity) and top-down forces (two levels of wolf-spider predation) on the population growth of Prokelisia planthoppers (P. dolus and P. marginata), the dominant insect herbivores on Spartina cordgrass throughout the intertidal marshes of North America. Treatments were designed to mimic combinations of plant characteristics and predator densities that occur naturally across habitats in the field.There were complex interactive effects between plant resources and spider predation on the population growth of planthoppers. The degree that spiders suppressed planthoppers depended on both plant nutrition and vegetation complexity, an interaction that was demonstrated both in the field and laboratory. Laboratory results showed that spiders checked planthopper populations most effectively on poor-quality Spartina with an associated matrix of thatch, all characteristics of high-marsh meadow habitats. It was also this combination of plant resources in concert with spiders that promoted the smallest populations of planthoppers in our field experiment. Planthopper populations were most likely to escape the suppressing effects of predation on nutritious plants without thatch, a combination of factors associated with observed planthopper outbreaks in low-marsh habitats in the field. Thus, there is important spatial variation in the relative strength of forces with bottom-up factors dominating under low-marsh conditions and top-down forces increasing in strength at higher elevations on the marsh.Enhancing host-plant biomass and nutrition did not strengthen top-down effects on planthoppers, even though nitro-en-rich plants supported higher densities of wolf spiders and other invertebrate predators in the field. Rather, planthopper populations, particularly those of Prokelisia marginata, escaped predator restraint on high-quality plants, a result we attribute to its mobile life history, enhanced colonizing ability, and rapid growth rate. Thus, our results for Prokelisia planthoppers suggest that the life history strategy of a species is an important mediator of top-down and bottom-up impacts.In laboratory mesocosms, enhancing plant biomass and nutrition resulted in increased spider reproduction, a,cascading effect associated with planthopper increases on high-quality plants. Although the adverse effects of spider predation on planthoppers cascaded down and fostered increased plant biomass in laboratory mesocosms, this result did not occur in the field where top-down effects attenuated. We attributed this outcome in part to the intraguild predation of other planthopper predators by wolf spiders. Overall, the general paradigm in this system is for bottom-up forces to dominate, and when predators do exert a significant suppressing effect on planthoppers, their impact is generally legislated by vegetation characteristics.},

abstract = {Although many studies now examine how multiple factors influence the dynamics of herbivore populations, few studies explicitly attempt to document where and when each is important and how they vary and interact. In fact, how temporal variation in top-down (natural enemies) and bottom-up (host plant resources) factors affect herbivore dynamics has been suggested as a particularly important yet poorly understood feature of terrestrial food webs. In this study we examined how temporal changes in predator density (wolf spiders, sheet-web builders, and mirid egg predators) and host-plant resources (plant quality and structural complexity) influ-ence the population dynamics of the dominant phytoph-agous insects on Atlantic-coast salt marshes, namely Prokelisia planthoppers (Homoptera: Delphacidae). We designed a factorial experiment in meadows of Spartina alterniflora to mimic natural variation in vegetation quality and structure by establishing two levels of plant nutrition (leaf nitrogen content) by fertilization, and two levels of habitat complexity by adding leaf litter (thatch). We then assessed seasonal changes in the strength of bottom-up (plant quality) and top-down (predator) im-pacts on planthopper populations. Planthopper popula-tions responded positively to increased plant quality treatments in late summer. Despite the greater number of planthopper adults colonizing fertilized Spartina plots compared to unfertilized controls, the offspring of these colonists were much less abundant at the end of the season in fertilized plots, particularly those with thatch. The initial colonization effect was later erased because arthropod predators selectively accumulated in fertilized plots where they inflicted significant mortality on all stages of planthoppers. Predators rapidly colonized fertilized plots and reached high densities well in advance of planthopper colonization, a response we attribute to their rapid aggregation in complex-structured habitats with readily available alternative prey. Our results suggest that plant resources not only mediate the strength of predator impacts on herbivore populations, but they also promote the coupling of predator and prey populations and thus influence when enemy impacts are realized.},

We test the reliability of previous estimates of plant species extinction and examine structure within the extinction data. Location The data analysed are for the three older Krakatau islands: Rakata, Sertung and Panjang in the Sunda Strait, Indonesia. Methods Our analysis is based on a comprehensive database incorporating all species records for each island since recolonization began after the 1883 sterilization, plus attributes such as distribution, phylogeny, population status and dispersal mechanism for each species. We employ a combination of univariate and multi-term analyses in analysing structure, and derive Minimal Adequate Models using binary logistic analyses of variance and covariance. We compare the 1883-1934 data set with the contemporary nora as represented by (1) 1979-83 records las used in previous analyses) and (2) 1979-94 data (original). Results The improved data for the contemporary flora reduces the number of missing species by one-third. We show that a variety of estimates of extinction rate can be produced depending on what assumptions are made concerning the status of particular species groups. Structural features in the extinction data persist despite the reduction in overall numbers of losses. Losses relate to: (Ij the number of islands on which a species originally occurred, (2) the primary dispersal mode, and (3) the original abundance of a species (e.g. whether it was known to have established a successful resident population, and whether it was in decline or increasing in c. 1930). The 'best' descriptive model employs the variables denoted under (3). A high proportion of losses comprised species introduced by people and rare or ephemeral species. Losses of 'residents' that had colonized naturally could largely be accounted for by reference to (1) successional loss of habitat and, to a lesser degree, (2) other habitat disturbance or loss. Main conclusions Previous analyses, based on a more limited data set, have significantly over-estimated extinction from the Krakatau flora. Few naturally colonizing and established species have become extinct. The findings indicate that caution is necessary in interpreting 'headline' island ecological rates, and in analysing and modelling such data. Examination of structural features of the data appear to be valuable both in providing ecological insights in their own right, and in enabling refinements to estimates of extinction and thus turnover.},

abstract = {Although predator effects on the number of locally coexisting species are well understood, there are few formal predictions of how these local predator effects influence patterns of prey diversity at larger spatial scales. Building on the theory of island biogeography, we develop a simple model that describes how predators can alter the scaling of diversity in prey metacommunities and compares the effects of generalist and specialist predators on regional prey diversity. Generalist predators, which consume prey randomly with respect to species identity, are predicted to reduce $\alpha$-diversity and increase $\beta$-diversity thereby maintaining regional diversity ($\gamma$-diversity). Alternatively, specialist predators, which filter out prey species intolerant of predators, are predicted to reduce both$\alpha$-diversity and$\beta$-diversity by causing the same prey species to be extirpated in each locality, resulting in regional prey species extinctions and lower $\gamma$-diversity. These distinct effects of generalist and specialist predators on prey diversity at different spatial scales are uniquely shaped by the extent of predation within those metacommunities. Overall, our model results make general predictions for how different types of predators can differentially affect prey diversity across spatial scales, allowing a more complete understanding of the possible implications of predator eradications or introductions for biodiversity.},

abstract = {Aim We searched for relationships between latitude and both the geographic range size and host specificity of fleas parasitic on small mammals. This provided a test for the hypothesis that specialization is lower, and thus niche breadth is wider, in high-latitude species than in their counterparts at lower latitudes. Location We used data on the host specificity and geographic range size of 120 Palaearctic flea species (Siphonaptera) parasitic on small mammals (Soricomorpha, Lagomorpha and Rodentia). Data on host specificity were taken from 33 regions, whereas data on geographic ranges covered the entire distribution of the 120 species. Methods Our analyses controlled for the potentially confounding effects of phylogenetic relationships among flea species by means of the independentcontrasts method. We used regressions and structural equation modelling to determine whether the latitudinal position of the geographic range of a flea covaried with either the size of its range or its host specificity. The latter was measured as the number of host species used, as well as by an index providing the average (and variance in) taxonomic distinctness among the host species used by a flea. Results Geographic range size was positively correlated with the position of the centre of the range; in other words, fleas with more northerly distributions had larger geographic ranges. Although the number of host species used by a flea did not vary with latitude, both the mean taxonomic distinctness among host species used and its variance increased significantly towards higher latitudes. Main conclusions The results indicate that niche breadth in fleas, measured in terms of both its spatial (geographic range size) and biological (host specificity) components, increases at higher latitudes. These findings are compatible with the predictions of recent hypotheses about latitudinal gradients.},

Using a simple model with only latitude of distribution as a predictor variable revealed a significant positive relationship with diet breadth. Previous studies, however, have shown that diet breadth is also correlated with butterfly range size, and in turn, that range size may be correlated with latitude of distribution. Including geographical range size in the model also turned out to have a profound effect on the results - to the extent that the relationship between latitude of distribution and diet breadth was effectively reversed.5. We conclude that, at least for this group of butterflies, there is no evidence for a positive correlation between latitude of species distribution and diet breadth when controlling for range size, and that the effect may actually even be reversed.},

abstract = {The statistical analysis of the structure of bipartite ecological networks has increased in importance in recent years. Yet, both algorithms and software packages for the analysis of network structure focus on properties of unipartite networks. In response, we describe BiMAT, an object-oriented MATLAB package for the study of the structure of bipartite ecological networks. BiMAT can analyze the structure of networks, including features such as modularity and nestedness, using a selection of widely-adopted algorithms. BiMAT also includes a variety of null models for evaluating the statistical significance of network properties. BiMAT is capable of performing multi-scale analysis of structure - a potential (and under-examined) feature of many biological networks. Finally, BiMAT relies on the graphics capabilities of MATLAB to enable the visualization of the statistical structure of bipartite networks in either matrix or graph layout representations. BiMAT is available as an open-source package at http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/cflores.},

abstract = {We used standardised techniques to assemble 18 food-webs in streams subject to four land uses; exotic pasture, native tussock, native forest, and pine plantation. There were clear differences in the algal productivity and standing crops of organic matter between the forested (native and pine) and grassland (tussock and pasture), but not within each grouping. Algal productivity was more than twice as high in the grassland sites, whereas the converse was true for organic matter standing crop. These differences in energy resources were correlated with differences in community composition and food-web structure. Although all streams had a generalist core of species, certain species of algae and invertebrates were predictably associated with either forested or grassland sites. Food-web structure in the forested and grassland sites was also distinct. Grassland foodwebs were complex, highly internally connected, and typified by a “triangular” shape. Forested food-webs in contrast were less highly connected, tended to have fewer trophic levels, and were “squarer” in shape. These results provide some support for the concept that energy supply may be an important contributing factor influencing stream community structure. In terms of riparian management, the results emphasise the importance of protecting representative vegetation around streams to protect stream communities.},

abstract = {1. Many lowland rivers in Western Europe have been substantially modified to aid land drainage and support the intensification of agriculture. Although there have been many attempts at rehabilitation, few have been systematically evaluated on ecological criteria. 2. Macroinvertebrates were assessed in 13 UK lowland rivers containing instream rehabilitation structures, seven with artificial riffles (intended to mimic natural gravel riffles) and six with flow deflectors (intended to increase flow, depth and substrate heterogeneity within the channel). In each river, invertebrates were compared between stretches of river with and without rehabilitation structures. 3. Rehabilitated and reference stretches were subdivided into different benthic and macrophyte habitats. Three macroinvertebrate samples were taken once in July/August 1999 from each habitat across all schemes and rivers. Current velocity, depth and substratum particle size were recorded at the same time from each habitat. 4. Artificial riffle benthos had faster current, a coarser substratum and was shallower than reference benthos. Depth and substratum particle size differed little between flow deflector and reference benthos, although velocity downstream of the deflector tip was greater, and velocity in the lee of the deflector lower, than reference benthos. At a habitat scale, the benthos of artificial riffles, but not flow deflectors, had higher abundance, taxon richness and diversity than reference benthos. The impact of artificial riffles was most marked for benthic rheophilic taxa. 5. In all rivers, macroinvertebrate diversity was highest in marginal macrophytes and abundance highest in instream macrophytes. Although invertebrate communities were distinct between artificial riffle (but not flow deflector) and reference benthos, these differences were negligible in comparison to those between benthic and macrophyte habitats. 6. Neither artificial riffles nor flow deflectors had any significant impact on the taxon richness of the benthos or of the rehabilitated stretch of the river as a whole. Invertebrate diversity of rehabilitated stretches related closely to that of reference stretches, indicating that larger scale factors constrained any impact of rehabilitation. 7. Synthesis and applications. Local rehabilitation structures appeared to have minor biological effects in lowland rivers. We suggest that post-project appraisal should be more rigorously applied to rehabilitation schemes, measuring success against more clearly defined goals. We also advocate a greater emphasis on large-scale riparian, floodplain and catchment rehabilitation, rather than small-scale channel rehabilitation. Such a change in approach needs more effective cooperation and collaboration between all catchment users.},

abstract = {Trophic information -who eats whom- ;and species' body sizes are two of the most basic descriptions necessary to understand community structure as well as ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Consumer-resource body size ratios between predators and their prey, and parasitoids and their hosts, have recently gained increasing attention due to their important implications for species' interaction strengths and dynamical population stability. This data set documents body sizes of consumers and their resources. We gathered body size data for the food webs of Skipwith Pond, a parasitoid community of grass-feeding chalcid wasps in British grasslands; the pelagic community of the Benguela system, a source web based on broom in the United Kingdom; Broadstone Stream, UK; the Grand Cari{\c{c}}aie marsh at Lake Neuch{\^{a}}tel, Switzerland; Tuesday Lake, USA; alpine lakes in the Sierra Nevada of California; Mill Stream, UK; and the eastern Weddell Sea Shelf, Antarctica. Further consumer-resource body size data are included for planktonic predators, predatory nematodes, parasitoids, marine fish predators, freshwater invertebrates, Australian terrestrial consumers, and aphid parasitoids. Containing 16 807 records, this is the largest data set ever compiled for body sizes of consumers and their resources. In addition to body sizes, the data set includes information on consumer and resource taxonomy, the geographic location of the study, the habitat studied, the type of the feeding interaction (e.g., predacious, parasitic) and the metabolic categories of the species (e.g., invertebrate, ectotherm vertebrate). The present data set was gathered with the intent to stimulate research on effects of consumer-resource body size patterns on food-web structure, interaction-strength distributions, population dynamics, and community stability. The use of a common data set may facilitate cross-study comparisons and understanding of the relationships between different scientific approaches and models.},

@article{Knapp2000,
abstract = {One of the most puzzling aspects of the worldwide decline of amphibians is their disappearance from within protected areas. Because these areas are ostensibly undisturbed, habitat alterations are generally perceived as unlikely causes. The introduction of non-native fishes into protected areas, however, is a common practice throughout the world and may exert an important influence on amphibian distributions. We quantified the role of introduced fishes (several species of trout) in the decline of the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) in California's Sierra Nevada through surveys of {\textgreater}1700 sites in two adjacent and historically fishless protected areas that differed primarily in the distribution of introduced fish. Negative effects of fishes on the distribution of frogs were evident at three spatial scales. At the landscape scale, comparisons between the two protected areas indicated that fish distribution was strongly negatively correlated with the distribution of frogs. At the watershed scale, the percentage of total water-body surface area occupied by fishes was a highly significant predictor of the percentage of total water-body surface area occupied by frogs. At the scale of individual water bodies, frogs were three times more likely to be found and six times more abundant in fishless than in fish-containing waterbodies, after habitat effects were accounted for. The strong effect of introduced fishes on mountain yellow-legged frogs appears to result from the unique life history of this amphibian which frequently restricts larvae to deeper water bodies, the same habitats into which fishes have most frequently been introduced. Because fish populations in at least some Sierra Nevada lakes can be removed with minimal effort, our results suggest that the decline of the mountain yellow-legged frog might be relatively easy to reverse.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that differences in body size between consumer and resource species may have important implications for interaction strengths, population dynamics, and eventually food web structure, function, and evolution. Still, the general distribution of consumer-'resource body-size ratios in real ecosystems, and whether they vary systematically among habitats or broad taxonomic groups, is poorly understood. Using a unique global database on consumer and resource body sizes, we show that the mean body-size ratios of aquatic herbivorous and detritivorous consumers are several orders of magnitude larger than those of carnivorous predators. Carnivorous predator-prey body-size ratios vary across different habitats and predator and prey types (invertebrates, ectotherm, and endotherm vertebrates). Predator-prey body-size ratios are on average significantly higher (1) in freshwater habitats than in marine or terrestrial habitats, (2) for vertebrate than for invertebrate predators, and (3) for invertebrate than for ectotherm vertebrate prey. If recent studies that relate body-size ratios to interaction strengths are general, our results suggest that mean consumer-resource interaction strengths may vary systematically across different habitat categories and consumer types.},

abstract = {Three Ecopath with Ecosim models were constructed to represent the eutrophication gradient along the south arm of the Mondego estuary (Portugal). Sampling was conducted in three areas representative of different environmental situations along the gradient: (a) a non-eutrophic area (Zostera noltii meadows), (b) an intermediate eutrophic area (macrophyte absent, although residual roots can still be found in the sediment, and the occasional formation of abundant macroalgae mats) and (c) a strongly eutrophic area (macrophyte community totally absent for at least a decade and strong, regularly occurring, blooms of Ulva spp.). Field, laboratory and literature information were used to construct the models, as well as empirical ecological knowledge gained from years of work on this system. Approximately 76 trophic groups (e.g. Phytoplankton and Zooplankton species), species and genera were included. These species were grouped into 43, 36 and 34 model groups for Zostera sp. meadows, intermediate eutrophic area and strongly eutrophic area, respectively. The groups were arranged by trophic similarity and habitat preferences; special distinction is given to macrofauna. Biomass, production, consumption, and diet are among the parameters used to describe each group. The sum of consumptions, exports, respiration, production, flow to detritus, total system throughput and annual rate of net primary production was always higher in the Zostera sp. meadows, followed by the strongly eutrophic area and, finally, by the intermediate eutrophic area. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Food webs in the real world are much more complex than food-web literature would have us believe.  This is illustrated by the web of the sand community in the Coachella Valley desert.  The biota include 174 species of vascular plants, 138 species of vertebrates, more than 55 species of arachnids, and an unknown (but great) number of microorganisms, insects (2,000-3,000 estimated species), acari, and nematodes.  Trophic relations are presented in a series of nested subwebs and delineations of the community.  Complexity arises from the large number of interactive species, the frequency of omnivory, age structure, looping, the lack of compartmentalization, and the complexity of the arthropod and soil faunas.  Web features found in the Coachella also characterize other communities and should produce equivalently complex webs.  If anything, diversity and complexity in most nondesert habitats are greater than those in deserts.  Patterns from the Coachella web are compared with theoretical predictions and "empirical generalizations" derived from catalogs of published webs.  The Coachella web differs greatly:  chains are longer, omnivory and loops are not rare, connectivity is greater (species interact with many more predators and prey), top predators are rare or nonexistent, and prey-to-predator ratios are greater than 1.0.  The evidence argues that actual community food webs are extraordinarily more complex than those webs cataloged by theorists.  I argue that most cataloged webs are oversimplified caricatures of actual communities.  That cataloged webs depict so few species, absurdly low ratios of predators on prey and prey eaten by predators, so few links, so little omnivory, a veritable absence of looping, and such a high proportion of top predators argues strongly that they poorly represent real biological communities.  Consequently, the practice of abstracting empirical regularities from such catalogs yields an inaccurate and artifactual view of trophic interactions within communities.  Contrary to strong assertions by many theorists, patterns from food webs of real communities generally do not support predictions arising from dynamic and graphic models of food-web structure.},

Measuring body size provides a relatively simple means of encapsulating and condensing a large amount of the biological information embedded within an ecological network. Recently, important advances have been made by incorporating body size into theoretical models that explore food web stability, the patterning of energy fluxes, and responses to perturbations. Because metabolic constraints underpin body-size scaling relationships, metabolic theory offers a potentially useful new framework within which to develop novel models to describe the structure and functioning of ecological networks and to assess the probable consequences of biodiversity change. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the size of these spheres of potential influence within complex communities is generally unknown. Here, we show for that species within large communities from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are on average two links apart, with {\textgreater}95{\%} of species typically within three links of each other. Species are drawn even closer as network complexity and, more unexpectedly, species richness increase. Our findings are based on seven of the largest and most complex food webs available as well as a food-web model that extends the generality of the empirical results.

abstract = {This chapter covers the concept of food web as a means to intuitively and synthetically visualize and communicate about complex interconnections among species in natural communities. Given this pervasive use of structural food webs as a teaching tool, it is perhaps surprising that they are rarely used in resource management to communicate about system-level impacts of human activities. Despite calls for more holistic approaches to "ecosystem management," a single species focus remains the norm. Broader considerations may include physical or biotic "habitat" protection, but rarely do they explicitly incorporate fundamental species interactions, such as feeding relations. In addition to qualitatively describing multivariate community changes in an intuitively tractable form, quantitative changes in web structural properties may offer novel insights into potential ecological consequences of these changes. Basic binary structural food webs provided a compact, visually accessible description of the dramatic, multivariate, community-level changes and recovery of alpine lakes in response to introduced trout. Stocked lakes with trout present had dramatically simplified food webs compared to lakes that never had fish. It has been well documented that species dynamics are difficult to infer from a simple knowledge of binary link structure alone. Similarly, nontrophic processes such as recruitment, abiotic conditions, disturbance, facilitations, and interference competition often regulate the presence and relative abundances of species in a community. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Food webs have markedly non-random network structure. Ecologists maintain that this non-random structure is key for stability, since large random ecological networks would invariably be unstable and thus should not be observed empirically. Here we show that a simple yet overlooked feature of natural food webs, the correlation between the effects of consumers on resources and those of resources on consumers, substantially accounts for their stability. Remarkably, random food webs built by preserving just the distribution and correlation of interaction strengths have stability properties similar to those of the corresponding empirical systems. Surprisingly, we find that the effect of topological network structure on stability, which has been the focus of countless studies, is small compared to that of correlation. Hence, any study of the effects of network structure on stability must first take into account the distribution and correlation of interaction strengths.},

abstract = {Power-law relationships are among the most well-studied functional relationships in biology. Recently the common practice of fitting power laws using linear regression (LR) on log-transformed data has been criticized, calling into question the conclusions of hundreds of studies. It has been suggested that nonlinear regression (NLR) is preferable, but no rigorous comparison of these two methods has been conducted. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the error distribution determines which method performs better, with NLR better characterizing data with additive, homoscedastic, normal error and LR better characterizing data with multiplicative, heteroscedastic, lognormal error. Analysis of 471 biological power laws shows that both forms of error occur in nature. While previous analyses based on log-transformation appear to be generally valid, future analyses should choose methods based on a combination of biological plausibility and analysis of the error distribution. We provide detailed guidelines and associated computer code for doing so, including a model averaging approach for cases where the error structure is uncertain.},

@article{Albrecht2014,
abstract = {Compartmentalization - the organization of ecological interaction networks into subsets of species that do not interact with other subsets (true compartments) - has been identified as a key property for the functioning, stability and evolution of ecological communities. Invasions by entomophilous invasive plants may profoundly alter the way interaction networks are compartmentalized. We analysed a comprehensive dataset of 40 paired plant-pollinator networks (invaded versus uninvaded) to test this hypothesis. We show that invasive plants have higher generalization levels with respect to their pollinators than natives. The consequences for network topology are that - rather than displacing native species from the network - plant invaders attracting pollinators into invaded modules tend to play new important topological roles (i.e. network hubs, module hubs and connectors) and cause role shifts in native species, creating larger modules that are more connected among each other. While the number of true compartments was lower in invaded compared with uninvaded networks, the effect of invasion on modularity was contingent on the study system. Interestingly, the generalization level of invasive plants partially explains this pattern, with more generalized invaders contributing to a lower modularity. Our findings indicate that the altered interaction structure of invaded networks makes them more robust against simulated random secondary species extinctions, but more vulnerable when the typically highly connected invasive plants go extinct first. The consequences and pathways by which biological invasions alter the interaction structure of plant-pollinator communities highlighted in this study may have important dynamical and functional implications, for example, by influencing multi-species reciprocal selection regimes and coevolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Network analysis (NA) is used to compare two ecosystems with different spatial extents to understand the different patterns and dynamics that arise. NA allows one to study the system at different scales: At the level of bilateral interactions, input-output structure matrices are calculated to look at the direct and indirect effects that one flow has on another; at the functional level, the food web is mapped into a concatenated trophic chain, and all simple, directed biogeochemical cycles are identified and separated from the supporting dissipative flows; and at the system's level global variables describe the state of development of the total network. The systems in question are the Everglades graminoid marsh and the adjacent cypress swamp. The graminoid marsh is essentially a two-dimensional system, with reduced diversity of primary producers, and a more focussed dependency of higher trophic levels on one particular primary producer, the periphyton. Although the cypress swamp system contains most of the same flora and fauna as the graminoids, it extends into a third dimension, and contains additional forms of terrestrial vegetation that increase the diversity of primary production, and thereby the resilience of the ecosystem. The importance of detritus to both systems is marked, although recycling within detritus is far more important in the graminoids than in the cypress. The linkages to higher trophic levels are relatively fewer in the graminoids, and the diversity of interactions between the detritus and higher trophic levels is much higher in the cypress. Overall, the presence of a third dimension imparts diversity and resilience to the cypress system, although the faster turnover rates of the graminoids make them more productive. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Baird1989,
abstract = {The full suite of carbon exchanges among the 36 most important components of the Chesapeake Bay mesohaline ecosystem is estimated to examine the seasonal trends in energy flow and the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. The networks provide infor- mation on the rates of energy transfer between the trophic components in a system wherein autochthonous production is dominated by phytoplankton production. A key seasonal feature of the system is that the summer grazing of primary producers by zooplankton is greatly reduced due to top-down control of zooplankton by ctenophores and sea nettles. Some of the ungrazed phytoplankton is left to fuel the activities of the pelagic microbial community, and the remainder falls to the bottom where it augments the deposit-feeding assemblage of polychaetes, amphipods, and blue crabs. There is a dominant seasonal cycle in the activities of all subcommunities, which is greatest in the summer and least in the cold season. However, the overall topology of the ecosystem does not appear to change substantially from season to season. Matrix operations can be employed to assess the various direct and indirect pathways by which each trophic group obtains energy. Often, indirect linkages reveal interesting differences. For example, although the bluefish and striped bass are both piscivorous pred- ators, 63{\%} of bluefish intake depends indirectly on benthic organisms, whereas striped bass depends mainly on planktonic organisms. Nearly all higher trophic species exhibit signif- icant indirect dependencies upon the upper components of the microbial loop, especially during summer. The complicated trophic network can be mapped into an eight-level trophic chain in the sense of Lindeman. Such analysis reveals that detritivory is about 10 times greater than herbivorous grazing in the Chesapeake system and that 70{\%} of detritus results from internal recycle. Annual efficiencies of trophic levels decrease as one ascends the chain. Major seasonal shifts in trophic efficiencies at higher levels appear to be modulated by how effectively microscopic zooplankton (mostly ciliates) are cropped by their predators. Av- erage trophic efficiency is 9.6{\%}. Despite the existence of eight trophic levels, the average level at which each species feeds always remains below 5. One "pest" species (the coelen- terate Chrysaora quinquecirrha) feeds rather high on the trophic pyramid and may exert a heretofore unappreciated level of control on the planktonic food chain. The number of cycles present in the network is surprisingly few, despite the fact that a relatively large and seemingly constant amount (23.2{\%}) of total system activity is devoted to recycling. This combination of factors possibly indicates a stressed ecosystem. A study of the rate-limiting links in the seasonal networks of recycling of material within the plankton reconfirms the shift of predator control from crustaceous zooplankton in spring- time to the sea nettle (Chrysaora quinquecirrha) during summer months. The collection of cycles present in the system is disjoint; there is no overlap between the cycles among the planktonic community and the circulations among the deposit feeders and nekton. The filter-feeding benthos and fish do not participate in any cycling, but serve rather as bridges to shift carbon and energy from the planktonic community into the benthic-nektonic subsystems. Neither do most of the members of the microbial loop engage in any recycle of carbon, functioning instead as a dissipative shunt of energy out of the system.},

abstract = {Species-rich tropical communities are expected to be more specialized than their temperate counterparts [1-3]. Several studies have reported increasing biotic specialization toward the tropics [4-7], whereas others have not found latitudinal trends once accounting for sampling bias [8, 9] or differences in plant diversity [10, 11]. Thus, the direction of the latitudinal specialization gradient remains contentious. With an unprecedented global data set, we investigated how biotic specialization between plants and animal pollinators or seed dispersers is associated with latitude, past and contemporary climate, and plant diversity. We show that in contrast to expectation, biotic specialization of mutualistic networks is significantly lower at tropical than at temperate latitudes. Specialization was more closely related to contemporary climate than to past climate stability, suggesting that current conditions have a stronger effect on biotic specialization than historical community stability. Biotic specialization decreased with increasing local and regional plant diversity. This suggests that high specialization of mutualistic interactions is a response of pollinators and seed dispersers to low plant diversity. This could explain why the latitudinal specialization gradient is reversed relative to the latitudinal diversity gradient. Low mutualistic network specialization in the tropics suggests higher tolerance against extinctions in tropical than in temperate communities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Aim The network structure of food webs plays an important role in the maintenance of diversity and ecosystem functioning in ecological communities. Previous research has found that ecosystem size, resource availability, assembly history and biotic interactions can potentially drive food web structure. However, the relative influence of climatic variables that drive broad-scale biogeographic patterns of species richness and composition has not been explored for food web structure. In this study, we assess the influence of broad-scale climatic variables in addition to known drivers of food web structure on replicate observations of a single aquatic food web, sampled from the leaves of the pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), at different geographic sites across a broad latitudinal and climatic range. Location Using standardized sampling methods, we conducted an extensive `snapshot' survey of 780 replicated aquatic food webs collected from the leaves of the pitcher plant S. purpurea at 39 sites from northern Florida to Newfoundland and westward to eastern British Columbia. Methods We examined correlations of 15 measures of food web structure at the pitcher and site scales with geographic variation in temperature and precipitation, concentrations of nutrients from atmospheric nitrogen deposition, resource availability, ecosystem size and the abundance of the pitcher plant mosquito (Wyeomyia smithii), a potential keystone species. Results At the scale of a single pitcher plant leaf, linkage density, species richness, measures of chain length and the proportion of omnivores in a web all increased with pitcher volume. Linkage density and species richness were greater at high-latitude sites, which experience low mean temperatures and precipitation and high annual variation in both of these variables. At the site scale, variation in 8 of the 15 food web metrics decreased at higher latitudes, and variation in measures of chain length increased with the abundance of mosquitoes. Main conclusions Ecosystem size and climatic variables related to latitude were most strongly correlated with network structure of the Sarracenia food web. However, in spite of large sample sizes, thorough standardized sampling and the large geographic extent of the survey, even the best-fitting models explained less than 40{\%} of the variation in food web structure. In contrast to biogeographic patterns of species richness, food web structure was largely independent of broad-scale climatic variables. The large proportion of unexplained variance in our analyses suggests that stochastic assembly may be an important determinant of local food web structure.},

abstract = {The latitudinal gradient in diversity is widely acknowledged, but the mechanisms contributing to this pattern are still poorly known. Given that the species have environmental optima, a central issue is how species' niche parameters, i.e. niche breadth and niche position, vary along the latitudinal gradient. In this study, we examined the determinants of fish distribution and the variability in species' niche breadth and position along latitudinal gradient using a regional data set of boreal lakes. Results of the Outlying Mean Index analysis showed that the fish community structure was jointly controlled by a number of environmental factors, ranging from water chemistry and temperature to local physical factors such as lake area and depth. Corroborating the number of earlier findings, the regional occupancy of species was more strongly governed by the niche position than the niche breadth, although both showed a significant relationship with the regional distribution. When the latitudinal variability in niche parameters of the main taxonomic groups was analysed, both percids and cyprinids, being cool water species, showed significant decrease in niche breadth northwards as we predicted. By contrast, the niche position and latitude were non-significantly correlated in percids and salmonids, and negatively correlated in cyprinids, the latter showing the opposite pattern as we predicted. However, even if only a part of our predictions was supported, the results generally implied that the examination of latitudinal variability in the niche properties is potentially highly rewarding, not only in estimation of present community structure in lakes but also for predictions of species' responses to climate change.},

abstract = {Aim One of the mechanisms proposed to explain the tendency for geographical range size to increase from the equator to the poles, known as the Rapoport effect, is the climatic variability hypothesis. It states that, towards higher latitudes, greater seasonal climatic variability is the most important pressure that selectively promotes greater general climatic tolerance of species, and therefore also more extensive species ranges. In order to test this hypothesis, we explore the influence of climate, area and biome diversity on the latitudinal gradient of climatic specialization. Location The study used the large mammal assemblage from Africa. Methods The degree of climatic specialization of African large mammals (Primates, Carnivora, Proboscidea, Perissodactyla, Hyracoidea, Tubulidentata, Artiodactyla and Pholidota) is investigated using the biomic specialization index (BSI) for each mammal species, based on the number of biomes it inhabits. We studied the influence of 11 climatic and biogeographical predictors in the latitudinal pattern of biomic specialization. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to identify the strongest predictors of biomic specialization in Africa and, separately, in both continental hemispheres. We also studied differences among taxonomical groups (primates, carnivores and artiodactyls). We used correlograms generated using Moran's I coefficients to control for spatial autocorrelation in all these analyses. Results Average BSI values for successive 1 degrees-latitude bands generally decline towards the equator and temperature variability emerged as the most predictive factor in the regression model for the whole continent, thus supporting the climatic variability hypothesis. Nevertheless, there are differences between hemispheres and among taxa. While temperature variability is the most important predictor of latitudinal variability in biomic specialization in most of the regression models for the northern hemisphere, continental area for each latitudinal band is the best predictor in all the regression models in the southern hemisphere. Main conclusions It appears that similar patterns in latitudinal variation in average BSI may be caused by different factors in the two hemispheres. We suggest that the strong north-south geographical asymmetry of Africa, which influences its biogeographical structure, and the presence of land connections with Eurasia in the northern hemisphere are responsible for the observed patterns. Our data illustrate the influence of continental biogeographical structure and history on macroecological patterns.},

abstract = {Using a combination of stable isotope analysis of delta13C and delta15N and long-term census data on population abundances for meiofauna in tropical aquatic rock pools, we provide evidence that species which exhibit greater variation in delta13C, an indication of a greater range of distinct carbon sources in their diet, have more stable populations than species with lower variation in delta13C. This link between increased isotope variability and reduced population variability, however, did not hold for delta15N. This suggests that increases in population stability were due to non-omnivorous feeding on multiple carbon sources within a trophic level rather than omnivorous feeding on multiple carbon sources across trophic levels. Our findings corroborate MacArthur's original hypothesis that populations that can access a greater range of resources are more stable than those which consume a more restricted range of resources.},

Body weight is not correlated with habitat, zonation, activity cycle or latitudinal gra- dients. Significant differences in body weight are found among insectivorous, herbivorous and carnivorous species, and some of these differences may relate to energetic con- straints.

abstract = {This simulation study demonstrates how the choice of estimation method affects indexes of fit and parameter bias for different sample sizes when nested models vary in terms of specification error and the data demonstrate different levels of kurtosis. Using a fully crossed design, data were generated for 11 conditions of peakedness, 3 conditions of misspecification, and 5 different sample sizes. Three estimation methods (maximum likelihood [ML], generalized least squares [GLS], and weighted least squares [WLS]) were compared in terms of overall fit and the discrepancy between estimated parameter values and the true parameter values used to generate the data. Consistent with earlier findings, the results show that ML compared to GLS under conditions of misspecification provides more realistic indexes of overall fit and less biased parameter values for paths that overlap with the true model. However, despite recommendations found in the literature that WLS should be used when data are not normally distributed, we find that WLS under no conditions was preferable to the 2 other estimation procedures in terms of parameter bias and fit. In fact, only for large sample sizes (N = 1,000 and 2,000) and mildly misspecified models did WLS provide estimates and fit indexes close to the ones obtained for ML and GLS. For wrongly specified models WLS tended to give unreliable estimates and over-optimistic values of fit.},

abstract = {Understanding how biotic mechanisms confer stability in variable environments is a fundamental quest in ecology, and one that is becoming increasingly urgent with global change. Several mechanisms, notably a portfolio effect associated with species richness, compensatory dynamics generated by negative species covariance and selection for stable dominant species populations can increase the stability of the overall community. While the importance of these mechanisms is debated, few studies have contrasted their importance in an environmental context. We analyzed nine long-term data sets of grassland species composition to investigate how two key environmental factors, precipitation amount and variability, may directly influence community stability and how they may indirectly influence stability via biotic mechanisms. We found that the importance of stability mechanisms varied along the environmental gradient: strong negative species covariance occurred in sites characterized by high precipitation variability, whereas portfolio effects increased in sites with high mean annual precipitation. Instead of questioning whether compensatory dynamics are important in nature, our findings suggest that debate should widen to include several stability mechanisms and how these mechanisms vary in importance across environmental gradients.},

We conducted a large-scale, multiyear manipulative experiment to investigate the impacts of V. pensylvanica on the structure and behavior of the M. polymorpha pollinator community, including competitive mechanisms related to resource availability. Our results demonstrate that V. pensylvanica, through both superior exploitative and interference competition, influences resource partitioning and displaces native and nonnative M. polymorpha pollinators. Furthermore, the restructuring of the pollinator community due to V. pensylvanica competition and predation results in a significant decrease in the overall pollinator effectiveness and fruit set of M. polymorpha. This research highlights both the competitive mechanisms and contrasting effects of social insect invaders on plant-pollinator mutualisms and the role of competition in pollinator community structure.},

abstract = {Dystrophic lakes are widespread in temperate regions and intimately interact with surrounding terrestrial ecosystems in energy and nutrient dynamics, yet the relative importance of autochthonous and allochthonous resources to consumer production in dystrophic lakes remains controversial. We argue that allochthonous organic matter quantitatively dominates over photosynthetic autotrophs in dystrophic lakes, but that autotrophs are higher in diet quality and more important for consumers as they contain essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). In a field study, we tested the hypotheses that (1) autochthonous primary production is the main driver for consumer production, despite being limited by light availability and low nutrient supplies, and greater supply of allochthonous carbon, (2) the relative contribution of autotrophs to consumers is directly related to their tissue PUFA concentrations, and (3) methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) provide an energy alternative for consumers. Pelagic and benthic consumer taxa representing different trophic levels were sampled from five dystrophic lakes: isopod Asellus aquaticus, megalopteran Sialis lutaria, dipteran Chaoborus flavicans, and perch Perca fluviatilis. Based on carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, the relative contributions of autochthonous (biofilms and seston) and allochthonous (coarse particulate and dissolved organic matter) resources and MOB to these taxa were 47–79{\%}, 9–44{\%} and 7–12{\%} respectively. Results from fatty acid (FA) analyses show that the relative $\omega$3-FA and PUFA concentrations increased with trophic level (Asellus {\textless} Sialis and Chaoborus {\textless} Perca). Also, eicosapentaenoic-acid (EPA), $\omega$3-FA and PUFA concentrations increased with the autochthonous contribution in consumers, i.e., a 47–79{\%} biofilm and/or seston diet resulted in tissue EPA of 4.2–18.4, $\omega$3 FAs of 11.6–37.0 and PUFA of 21.6–61.0 mg/g dry mass. The results indicate that consumers in dystrophic lakes predominantly rely on energy from autotrophs and that their PUFA concentrations are dependent on the relative contribution of these autochthonous resources. The limited energy support from MOB suggests they are not negligible and are potentially an integral part of the food webs. Our findings show that autochthonous resources are the main driver of secondary production even in dystrophic lakes and offer new insights into the functioning of these ecosystems.},

abstract = {Lake ecosystems are strongly linked to their terrestrial surroundings by material and energy fluxes across ecosystem boundaries. However, the contribution of terrestrial particulate organic carbon (tPOC) from annual leaf fall to lake food webs has not yet been adequately traced and quantified. In this study, we conducted whole-lake experiments to trace artificially added tPOC through the food webs of two shallow lakes of similar eutrophic status, but featuring alternative stable regimes (macrophyte rich vs. phytoplankton dominated). Lakes were divided with a curtain, and maize (Zea mays) leaves were added, as an isotopically distinct tPOC source, into one half of each lake. To estimate the balance between autochthonous carbon fixation and allochthonous carbon input, primary production and tPOC and tDOC (terrestrial dissolved organic carbon) influx were calculated for the treatment sides. We measured the stable isotope ratios of carbon ($\delta$13C) of about 800 samples from all trophic consumer levels and compared them between lake sides, lakes, and three seasons. Leaf litter bag experiments showed that added maize leaves were processed at rates similar to those observed for leaves from shoreline plants, supporting the suitability of maize leaves as a tracer. The lake-wide carbon influx estimates confirmed that autochthonous carbon fixation by primary production was the dominant carbon source for consumers in the lakes. Nevertheless, carbon isotope values of benthic macroinvertebrates were significantly higher with maize additions compared to the reference side of each lake. Carbon isotope values of omnivorous and piscivorous fish were significantly affected by maize additions only in the macrophyte-dominated lake and $\delta$13C of zooplankton and planktivorous fish remained unaffected in both lakes. In summary, our results experimentally demonstrate that tPOC in form of autumnal litterfall is rapidly processed during the subsequent months in the food web of shallow lakes and is channeled to secondary and tertiary consumers predominantly via the benthic pathways. A more intense processing of tPOC seems to be connected to a higher structural complexity in littoral zones, and hence may differ between shallow lakes of alternative stable states.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic signal is the tendency for closely related species to display similar trait values due to their common ancestry. Several methods have been developed for quantifying phylogenetic signal in univariate traits and for sets of traits treated simultaneously, and the statistical properties of these approaches have been extensively studied. However, methods for assessing phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional multivariate traits like shape are less well developed, and their statistical performance is not well characterized. In this article, I describe a generalization of the K statistic of Blomberg et al. (2003) that is useful for quantifying and evaluating phylogenetic signal in highly-dimensional multivariate data. The method (Kmult) is found from the equivalency between statistical methods based on covariance matrices and those based on distance matrices. Using computer simulations based on Brownian motion, I demonstrate that the expected value of Kmult remains at 1.0 as trait variation among species is increased or decreased, and as the number of trait dimensions is increased. By contrast, estimates of phylogenetic signal found with a squared-change parsimony procedure for multivariate data change with increasing trait variation among species and with increasing numbers of trait dimensions, confounding biological interpretations. I also evaluate the statistical performance of hypothesis testing procedures based on Kmult and find that the method displays appropriate Type I error and high statistical power for detecting phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional data. Statistical properties of Kmult were consistent for simulations using bifurcating and random phylogenies, for simulations using different numbers of species, for simulations that varied the number of trait dimensions, and for different underlying models of trait covariance structure. Overall these findings demonstrate that Kmult provides a useful means of evaluating phylogenetic signal in high-dimensional multivariate traits. Finally, I illustrate the utility of the new approach by evaluating the strength of phylogenetic signal for head shape in a lineage of Plethodon salamanders.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that rapid phenotypic evolution can strongly influence population dynamics, but how are such eco-evolutionary dynamics influenced by the source of trait variation (i.e., genetic variation or phenotypic plasticity)? To investigate this, we used rotifer?algae microcosm experiments to test how the phenotypic and genetic composition of prey populations affect predator?prey population dynamics. We chose four genetically distinct strains of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that varied in their growth rate, standing levels of defense, and inducible defense. To additionally test for strain specificity of plasticity responses, we quantified protein expression of each strain in the presence and absence of rotifer predators (Brachionus calyciflorus). We then tested how different strain combinations influenced the outcome of pairwise competition trials with and without rotifer predation. We tracked individual strain frequencies using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and compared the observed dynamics to a suite of eco-evolutionary models of varying complexity. We found that variation in trade-offs between growth and defense between algal strains strongly influenced the outcome of competition and the overall predator?prey dynamics. Our purely ecological model of the observed dynamics, which allowed for the presence of phenotypic plasticity but no trait variation between strains, never outperformed any of our eco-evolutionary models in which strains could have different trait values. Our best fitting eco-evolutionary model allowed strains to differ in an inducible defense trait. Overall, our results provide some of the first experimental evidence that variation in phenotypically plastic responses among prey genotypes can be an important component of eco-evolutionary dynamics in a predator?prey system.},

Empirical studies suggest many consumers engage in such behavior by feeding on prey items from both living-autotroph (green) and detritus-based (brown) webs-what we term 'multi-channel feeding'-yet we know little about how common such feeding is across systems and trophic levels, or its effect on system stability. Considering 23 empirical webs, we find that multi-channel feeding is equally common across terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems, with {\textgreater}50{\%} of consumers classified as multi-channel consumers. Multi-channel feeding occurred most often at the first consumer level, indicating ...},

abstract = {Intraspecific variation may shape colonization of new habitat patches through a variety of mechanisms. In particular, trait variation among colonizing individuals can produce intraspecific priority effects (IPEs), where early arrivers of a single species affect the establishment or growth of later conspecifics. While we have some evidence for the importance of IPEs, we lack a general understanding of factors affecting their presence or magnitude across a landscape. Specifically, IPEs should depend strongly on success of colonizers in the new habitat patch. This success hinges on interactions between colonizer traits and local selective pressures, but such context dependence remains unexplored experimentally. We addressed this gap by looking for the dynamical signature of IPEs in environments with and without a selective (parasite) pressure. We tested whether IPEs affected the population dynamics of a zooplankton host species (Daphnia dentifera) collected from two populations showing a tradeoff between gro...},

abstract = {Most phylogenetically based statistical methods for the analysis of quantitative or continuously varying phenotypic traits assume that variation within species is absent or at least negligible, which is unrealistic for many traits. Within-species variation has several components. Differences among populations of the same species may represent either phylogenetic divergence or direct effects of environmental factors that differ among populations (phenotypic plasticity). Within-population variation also contributes to within-species variation and includes sampling variation, instrument-related error, low repeatability caused by fluctuations in behavioral or physiological state, variation related to age, sex, season, or time of day, and individual variation within such categories. Here we develop techniques for analyzing phylogenetically correlated data to include within-species variation, or "measurement error" as it is often termed in the statistical literature. We derive methods for (i) univariate analyses, including measurement of "phylogenetic signal," (ii) correlation and principal components analysis for multiple traits, (iii) multiple regression, and (iv) inference of "functional relations," such as reduced major axis (RMA) regression. The methods are capable of incorporating measurement error that differs for each data point (mean value for a species or population), but they can be modified for special cases in which less is known about measurement error (e.g., when one is willing to assume something about the ratio of measurement error in two traits). We show that failure to incorporate measurement error can lead to both biased and imprecise (unduly uncertain) parameter estimates. Even previous methods that are thought to account for measurement error, such as conventional RMA regression, can be improved by explicitly incorporating measurement error and phylogenetic correlation. We illustrate these methods with examples and simulations and provide Matlab programs.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation studies have produced complex results that are challenging to synthesize. Inconsistencies among studies may result from variation in the choice of landscape metrics and response variables, which is often compounded by a lack of key statistical or methodological information. Collating primary datasets on biodiversity responses to fragmentation in a consistent and flexible database permits simple data retrieval for subsequent analyses. We present a relational database that links such field data to taxonomic nomenclature, spatial and temporal plot attributes, and environmental characteristics. Field assessments include measurements of the response(s) (e.g., presence, abundance, ground cover) of one or more species linked to plots in fragments within a partially forested landscape. The database currently holds 9830 unique species recorded in plots of 58 unique landscapes in six of eight realms: mammals 315, birds 1286, herptiles 460, insects 4521, spiders 204, other arthropods 85, gastropods 70, annelids 8, platyhelminthes 4, Onychophora 2, vascular plants 2112, nonvascular plants and lichens 320, and fungi 449. Three landscapes were sampled as long-term time series ({\textgreater}10 years). Seven hundred and eleven species are found in two or more landscapes. Consolidating the substantial amount of primary data available on biodiversity responses to fragmentation in the context of land-use change and natural disturbances is an essential part of understanding the effects of increasing anthropogenic pressures on land. The consistent format of this database facilitates testing of generalizations concerning biologic responses to fragmentation across diverse systems and taxa. It also allows the re-examination of existing datasets with alternative landscape metrics and robust statistical methods, for example, helping to address pseudo-replication problems. The database can thus help researchers in producing broad syntheses of the effects of land use. The database is dynamic and inclusive, and contributions from individual and large-scale data-collection efforts are welcome.},

We analyzed the d13Cand d15N values of 15 prey species consti- tuting 84{\%} of the species found in stomach contents. We used these data to estab- lish a trophic enrichment factor (TEF) to inform dietary analysis using a Bayesian isotope mixing model. We document a TEF of 0{\&} and 2.0{\&} for d13Cand d15N, respectively. The dietary results showed that all demographic groups relied heavily on low trophic level seagrass-associated prey. Bayesian standard ellipse areas (SEAb) were calculated to assess diversity in resource use. The SEAb of females was nearly four times larger than that of males indicating varied resource use, likely a conse- quence of small home ranges and habitat specialization. Juveniles possessed an inter- mediate SEAb, generally feeding at a lower trophic level compared to females, potentially an effect of natal philopatry and immature foraging skills. The small SEAb of males reflects a high degree of specialization on seagrass associated prey. Pat- terns in resource use by the demographic groups are likely linked to differences in the relative importance of social and ecological factors.},

abstract = {1. Niche theory proposes that species differences underlie both coexistence within communities and the differentiation in species composition among communities via limiting similarity and environmental filtering. However, it has been difficult to extend niche theory to species-rich communities because of the empirical challenge of quantifying niches for many species. This has motivated the development of functional and phylogeny-based approaches in community ecology, which represent two different means of approximating niche attributes. 2. Here, we assess the utility of plant functional traits and phylogenetic relationships in predicting community assembly processes using the largest trait and phylogenetic data base to date for any set of species-rich communities. 3. We measured 17 functional traits for all 4672 individuals of 668 tree species co-occurring in nine tropical rain forest plots in French Guiana. Trait variation was summarized into two ordination axes that reflect species niche overlap. 4. We also generated a dated molecular phylogenetic tree based onDNA sequencing of two plastid loci (rbcL and matK) comprising 97{\%}of the individuals and 91{\%}of the species in the plots. 5. We found that, on average, co-occurring species had greater functional and, to a lesser extent, phylogenetic similarity than expected by chance. 6. We also found that functional traits and their ordination loadings showed significant, albeit weak, phylogenetic signal, suggesting that phylogenetic distance provides pertinent information on niche overlap in tropical tree communities. 7. Synthesis. We provide the most comprehensive examination to date of the relative importance of environmental filtering and limiting similarity in structuring tropical tree communities. Our results confirm that environmental filtering is the overriding influence on community assembly in these species-rich systems.},

abstract = {Understanding the evolution of specialization in host plant use by pollinators is often complicated by variability in the ecological context of specialization. Flowering communities offer their pollinators varying numbers and proportions of floral resources, and the uniformity observed in these floral resources is, to some degree, due to shared ancestry. Here, we find that pollinators visit related plant species more so than expected by chance throughout 29 plant–pollinator networks of varying sizes, with “clade specialization” increasing with commu- nity size. As predicted, less versatile pollinators showed more clade specializa- tion overall. We then asked whether this clade specialization varied with the ratio of pollinator species to plant species such that pollinators were changing their behavior when there was increased competition (and presumably a forced narrowing of the realized niche) by examining pollinators that were present in at least three of the networks. Surprisingly, we found little evidence that varia- tion in clade specialization is caused by pollinator species changing their behav- ior in different community contexts, suggesting that clade specialization is observed when pollinators are either restricted in their floral choices due to morphological constraints or innate preferences. The resulting pollinator shar- ing between closely related plant species could result in selection for greater pollinator specialization.},

abstract = {A recent advance in the phylogenetic comparative analysis of continuous traits has been explicit, model-based measurement of "phylogenetic signal" in data sets composed of observations collected from species related by a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic signal is a measure of the statistical dependence among species' trait values due to their phylogenetic relationships. Although phylogenetic signal is a measure of pattern (statistical dependence), there has nonetheless been a widespread propensity in the literature to attribute this pattern to aspects of the evolutionary process or rate. This may be due, in part, to the perception that high evolutionary rate necessarily results in low phylogenetic signal; and, conversely, that low evolutionary rate or stabilizing selection results in high phylogenetic signal (due to the resulting high resemblance between related species). In this study, we use individual-based numerical simulations on stochastic phylogenetic trees to clarify the relationship between phylogenetic signal, rate, and evolutionary process. Under the simplest model for quantitative trait evolution, homogeneous rate genetic drift, there is no relation between evolutionary rate and phylogenetic signal. For other circumstances, such as functional constraint, fluctuating selection, niche conservatism, and evolutionary heterogeneity, the relationship between process, rate, and phylogenetic signal is complex. For these reasons, we recommend against interpretations of evolutionary process or rate based on estimates of phylogenetic signal.},

abstract = { Switching" in predators which attack several prey species potentially can stabilize the numbers in prey populations. In switching, the number of attacks upon a species is disproportionately large when the species is abundant relative to other prey, and disproportionately small when the species is relatively rare. The null case for two prey species can be written: P1/P2 = cN1/N2, where P1/P2 is the ratio of the two prey expected in the diet, N1/N2 is the ratio given and c is a proportionality constant. Predators were sea—shore snails and prey were mussels and barnacles. Experiments in the laboratory modelled aspects of various natural situations. When the predator had a strong preference (c) between prey the data and the "null case" model were in good agreement. Preference could not altered by subjecting predators to training regimens. When preference was weak the data did not fit the model replicates were variable. Predators could be trained easily to one or other prey species. From a number of experiments it was concluded that in the weak—preference case no switch would occur in nature except where there is an opportunity for predators to become trained to the abundant species. A patchy distribution of the abundant prey could provide this opportunity. Given one prey species, snails caused a decreasing percentage mortality as prey numbers increased. This occurred also with 2 prey species present when preference was strong. When preference was weak the form of the response was unclear. When switching occurred the percentage prey mortality increased with prey density, giving potentially stabilizing mortality. The consequences of these conclusions for prey population regulation and for diversity are discussed.   Read More: http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1942352},

The measured workload at MLSS (112±22 watts) was significantly greater than the calculated workload using a lactate value of 4 mM (104±18 watts, p=0.016). The measured MLSS workload was not significantly different from the calculated workload using a fixed lactate value of 5.4 mM (115±19 watts, p=0.16) or 5.0 mM (113±19 watts, p=0.78) in the incremental tests. A fixed blood lactate value of 5 mM instead of 4 mM might be a better estimate in kayaking given the incremental workload test used in this study.},

Here I attempt to synthesize existing knowledge into a framework that can both identify crucial gaps in the theory as well as facilitate empirical investigations. The synthesis is based on two major axes, foodweb complexity and type of movement, and considers two types of spatial effects, foodweb persistence via a reduction in local extinction and foodweb diversity via an increase in species coexistence. It highlights both invariant properties that are robust to increasing foodweb complexity and emergent properties that result from the interplay between foodweb dynamics and type of movement.

While these direct and indirect effects of area on richness occur simultaneously, no research has examined how predation might contribute to SAR variation. We extend MacArthur and Wilson's equilibrium theory of island biogeography by including predation-induced shifts in prey extinction and predict that predators will reduce slopes of prey SARs. We provide support for this with data from two insular ecosystems: orthopteran richness in Ozark glades (rocky herbaceous communities within a forested matrix) with and without insectivorous lizards and zooplankton richness in freshwater ponds with and without zooplanktivorous fishes. Our results emphasize that anthropogenic activities yield simultaneous changes in processes altering diversity and that it is critical that we understand how these components of anthropogenic change interact to impact diversity.},

@article{Holt2002,
abstract = {Ecologists increasingly recognize that a consideration of spatial dynamics is essential for resolving many classical problems in community ecology. In the present paper, I argue that understanding how trophic interactions influence population stability can have important implications for the expression of spatial processes. I use two examples to illustrate this point. The first example has to do with spatial determinants of food chain length. Prior theoretical and empirical work has suggested that colonization-extinction dynamics can influence food chain length, at least for specialist consumers. I briefly review evidence and prior theory that food chain length is sensitive to area. A metacommunity scenario, in which each of various patches can have a food chain varying in length (but in which a consumer is not present on a patch unless its required resource is also present), shows that alternative landscape states are possible. This possibility arises if top predators moderate unstable interactions between intermediate predators and basal resources. The second example has to do with the impact of recurrent immigration on the stability of persistent populations. Immigration can either stabilize or destabilize local population dynamics. Moreover, an increase in immigration can decrease average population size for unstable populations with direct density-dependence, or in predator-prey systems with saturating functional responses. These theoretical models suggest that the interplay of temporal variation and spatial fluxes can lead to novel qualitative phenomena.},

abstract = {The species-area relationship may be the strongest empirical generalization in community ecology. We explore the effect of trophic rank upon the "strength" of the species-area relationship, as measured by z, the slope of a log(species) vs. log(area) plot. We present a simple model for communities closed to immigration, composed of "stacked specialist" food chains (where each plant species supports a specialist herbivore, which in turn sustains a specialist carnivore, etc.), that predicts z should increase with trophic rank; the model brings out some of the spatial implications of sequential dependencies among species. We discuss empirical examples in which the z values of taxa differing in trophic rank were reported and lament the shortage of well-documented examples in the ecological literature. Several examples fit the expected pattern, but others do not. We outline several additional reasons why z values might increase with trophic rank, even for generalists. If the qualitative assumptions of the model are relaxed, the predicted effect of trophic rank on z should weaken or even be reversed. Trophic rank may not have a systematic effect on the species-area relationship if (1) there are strong top-down interactions leading to prey extinctions; (2) communities are open, with recurrent immigration, particularly at higher trophic ranks; (3) consumers are facultative generalists, able to exist on a wide range of resource species; or (4) systems are far from equilibrium. Our aim in this thought piece is to stimulate community ecologists to link theoretical and empirical studies of food web structure with analyses of spatial dynamics and landscape ecology, and to encourage em- pirical studies of the species-area relationship focused on comparisons across taxa varying in trophic rank.},

abstract = {Multiple studies have shown that biodiversity loss can impair ecosystem processes, providing a sound basis for the general application of a precautionary approach to managing biodiversity. However, mechanistic details of species loss effects and the generality of impacts across ecosystem types are poorly understood. The functional niche is a useful conceptual tool for understanding redundancy, where the functional niche is defined as the area occupied by a species in an n-dimensional functional space. Experiments to assess redundancy based on a single functional attribute are biased towards finding redundancy, because species are more likely to have non-overlapping functional niches in a multi-dimensional functional space. The effect of species loss in any particular ecosystem will depend on i) the range of function and diversity of species within a functional group, ii) the relative partitioning of variance in functional space between and within functional groups, and iii) the potential for functional compensation (degree of functional niche overlap) of the species within a functional group. Future research on functional impairment with species loss should focus on identifying which species, functional groups, and ecosystems are most vulnerable to functional impairment from species loss, so that these can be prioritized for management activities directed at maintaining ecosystem function. This will require a better understanding of how the organization of diversity into discrete functional groups differs between different communities and ecosystems.},

abstract = {Understanding what structures ecological communities is vital to answering questions about extinctions, environmental change, trophic cascades, and ecosystem functioning. Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65{\%} of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model's successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction. The model results support the hypothesis that individual behavior, subject to natural selection, determines individual diets and that food web structure is the sum of these individual decisions.},

While a significant amount is known about the types of communities and species that suffer secondary extinctions, little is known about the consequences of secondary extinctions for biodiversity. Here we examine the effect of these secondary extinctions on trophic diversity, the range of trophic roles played by the species in a community. Our analyses of natural and model food webs show that secondary extinctions cause loss of trophic diversity greater than that expected from chance, a result that is robust to variation in food web structure, distribution of interactions strengths, functional response, and adaptive foraging. Greater than expected loss of trophic diversity occurs because more trophically unique species are more vulnerable to secondary extinction. This is not a straightforward consequence of these species having few links with others but is a complex function of how direct and indirect interactions affect species persistence. A positive correlation between a species' extinction probability and the importance of its loss defines high-risk species and should make their conservation a priority.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Are local ecological communities ever saturated with species? That is, do they ever reach a point where species from the regional pool are unable to invade the local habitat because of exclusion by resident species? 2. We review the theoretical evidence for saturation in various community models and find that non-interactive models predict the absence of saturation as expected, but that interactive models do not uniformly predict saturation. 3. Instead, models where coexistence is based on niche space heterogeneity predict saturation, whereas those where coexistence is based upon spatial heterogeneity yield mixed predictions. 4. Thus, theory says that species interactions are a necessary but not sufficient condition for local saturation in ecological time. 5. We then argue that unsaturated (Type I) assemblages are likely to be ubiquitous in nature and that even saturated (Type II) assemblages may not show hard limits to richness over evolutionary time-scales. 6. If local richness is not often saturated, then regional richness is freed from local constraint, and other limits on regional richness (which, in turn, limit local rich- ness) become important, including phylogenetic diversification over evolutionary time-scales. 7. Our speculations inevitably suggest that the principal direction of control for species richness is from regional to local. If correct, then the key to community structure may lie in extrinsic biogeography rather than in intrinsic local processes, making community ecology a more historical science.},

abstract = {The architecture of mutualistic networks facilitates coexistence of individual participants by minimizing competition relative to facilitation(1,2). However, it is not known whether this benefit is received by each participant node in proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence. This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced by individual nodes in a network(3-5). We address this question by applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here we report two main results. First, nodes contribute heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a strong contributor tends to decrease overall network persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor. Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of these results to other cooperative networks by analysing a 15-year time series of the interactions between designer and contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As with the ecological networks, a firm's survival probability decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases. Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially address questions about the impact of invasive species in ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems.},

abstract = {Although the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning has become a major focus in ecology, its significance in a fluctuating environment is still poorly understood. According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species' productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

When species richness is high, however, ecosystem processes seem clearly insensitive to considerable variation in biodiversity. Some elementary principles from reliability engineering where engineering redundancy is a valued part of systems design, suggest that we should rethink our stance on species redundancy. For example, a central tenet of reliability engineering is that reliability always increases as redundant components are added to a system, a principle that directly supports redundant species as guarantors of reliable ecosystem functioning. I argue that we should embrace species redundancy and perceive redundancy as a critical feature of ecosystems which must be preserved if ecosystems are to function reliably and provide us with goods and services. My argument is derived from basic principles of reliability engineering which demonstrate that the probability of reliable system performance is closely tied to the level of engineered redundancy in its design. Empirical demonstrations of the value of species redundancy in ecosystem reliability would provide new insights into the ecology of communities and the value of species conservation.},

abstract = {Spatial coexistence depends on a variety of biological and physical processes, and the relative scales of these processes may promote or suppress coexistence. We model plant competition in a spatially varying environment to show how shifting scales of dis- persal, competition, and environmental heterogeneity affect coexis- tence. Spatial coexistence mechanisms are partitioned into three types: the storage effect, nonlinear competitive variance, and growth- density covariance. We first describe how the strength of each of these mechanisms depends on covariances between population den- sities and between population densities and the environment, and we then explain how changes in the scales of dispersal, competition, and environmental heterogeneity should affect these covariances.Our quantitative approach allows us to show how changes in the scales of biological and physical processes can shift the relative importance of different classes of spatial coexistence mechanisms and gives us a more complete understanding of how environmental heterogeneity can enable coexistence. For example, we show how environmental heterogeneity can promote coexistence even when competing species have identical responses to the environment. Keywords:},

Biologically reasonable models account for 98{\%} of the variance in species number. The data are adequate to permit determination of immigration and extinction curves and the values of seven associated parameters. The resulting curves are very concave. Extinction rates vary almost exactly as the reciprocal of area, but the effect of area on immigration rates is slight. Recognition of major differences among species in immigration and extinction rates and in dispersal distances proves essential to a successful model.},

abstract = {A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks--their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits--but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.},

This interpretation has been tested by determining the land and freshwater birds breeding on the nine Channel Islands off southern California in 1968 and comparing the results with a similar survey for the years up to 1917. Most of the islands were found to be in equilibrium as to number of species, but between 17 and 62 per cent of the 1917 breeding species had disappeared by 1968, and an approximately equal number of new immigrant species had become established. Percentage turnover rates vary inversely as insular species diversities, with no effect of distance apparent.},

@article{Case1975,
abstract = {The distribution of lizard species and numbers on islands in the Gulf of Cali- fornia was examined in light of island biogeographic theory. Using linear multiple regression techniques with the percent completeness of the island's lizard fauna as the dependent variable (LS), the relationship and predictive power of several island independent variables (in original and transformed forms) were explored. The results of this analysis differed sharply for dif- ferent subsets of islands. The independent variable accounting for the most variance in LS for oceanic islands was island area; their distance from the mainland explained most of the residual variance. For land-bridge islands, maximum island elevation was the most predictive single variable, and island distance was least important. In both these island groups and considering all the islands together, island area, elevation, and the number of perennial plant species were highly correlated and explained little of each others residual variance. On 12 islands, diversity of shrub volume was also measured and was found to have less predictive power than the other variables considered. Life history attributes of each lizard species were gleaned from the literature and com- pared with the respective colonizing abilities of the species. In general, species occurring on many Gulf islands (e.g., Uta stansburiana) may reach high mainland population densities, have potentially high birth rates and high death rates, and may be habitat generalists. Species absent from most islands and most likely to go extinct on land-bridge islands (e.g., Xantusia 'igilis) have the converse of these attributes. The reasons for the divergence of these results and those expected from predictions is discussed. Lizard fauna relaxation times were calculated for land-bridge islands and were found to be inversely related to island area as predicted from island biogeographic theory. Extinction rates for lizards are about one half as high as those calculated for birds and mammals. Timed searches for lizards were also performed on most of the islands and the adjacent Baja California peninsula. These revealed that the numbers of Uta and total lizard numbers were both inversely related to the number of lizard species occupying an island. The probable reasons for such excess density compensation were examined, and it was concluded that differences in predation intensity, insect productivity, and possibly competitive interference account for the extremely high number of lizards on some small isolated islands.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between diversity and stability requires a knowledge of how species interact with each other and how each is affected by the environment. The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Damage caused by introduced species results from the high population densities and large body sizes that they attain in their new location. Escape from the effects of natural enemies is a frequent explanation given for the success of introduced species. Because some parasites can reduce host density and decrease body size, an invader that leaves parasites behind and encounters few new parasites can experience a demographic release and become a pest. To test whether introduced species are less parasitized, we have compared the parasites of exotic species in their native and introduced ranges, using 26 host species of molluscs, crustaceans, fishes, birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles. Here we report that the number of parasite species found in native populations is twice that found in exotic populations. In addition, introduced populations are less heavily parasitized (in terms of percentage infected) than are native populations. Reduced parasitization of introduced species has several causes, including reduced probability of the introduction of parasites with exotic species (or early extinction after host establishment), absence of other required hosts in the new location, and the host-specific limitations of native parasites adapting to new hosts.},

@article{Courchamp2003,
abstract = {The invasion of ecosystems by exotic species is currently viewed as one of the most important sources of biodiversity loss. The largest part of this loss occurs on islands, where indigenous species have often evolved in the absence of strong competition, herbivory, parasitism or predation. As a result, introduced species thrive in those optimal insular ecosystems affecting their plant food, competitors or animal prey. As islands are characterised by a high rate of endemism, the impacted populations often correspond to local subspecies or even unique species. One of the most important taxa concerning biological invasions on islands is mammals. A small number of mammal species responsible for most the damage to invaded insular ecosystems: rats, cats, goats, rabbits, pigs and a few others. The effect of alien invasive species may be simple or very complex, especially since a large array of invasive species, mammals and others, can be present simultaneously and interact among themselves as well as with the indigenous species. In most cases, introduced species generally have a strong impact and they often are responsible for the impoverishment of the local flora and fauna. The best response to these effects is almost always to control the alien population, either by regularly reducing their numbers, or better still, by eradicating the population as a whole from the island. Several types of methods are currently used: physical (trapping, shooting), chemical (poisoning) and biological (e.g. directed use of diseases). Each has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, depending on the mammal species targeted. The best strategy is almost always to combine several methods. Whatever the strategy used, its long-term success is critically dependent on solid support from several different areas, including financial support, staff commitment, and public support, to name only a few. In many cases, the elimination of the alien invasive species is followed by a rapid and often spectacular recovery of the impacted local populations. However, in other cases, the removal of the alien is not sufficient for the damaged ecosystem to revert to its former state, and complementary actions, such as species re-introduction, are required. A third situation may be widespread: the sudden removal of the alien species may generate a further disequilibrium, resulting in further or greater damage to the ecosystern. Given the numerous and complex population interactions among island species, it is difficult to predict the outcome of the removal of key species, such as a top predator. This justifies careful pre-control study and preparation prior to initiating the eradication of an alien species, in order to avoid an ecological catastrophe. In addition, long-term monitoring of the post-eradication ecosystem is crucial to assess success and prevent reinvasion.},

abstract = {The island of Guam has experienced a precipitous decline of its native forest birds, and several lines of evidence implicate the introduced brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) as the cause of the range reductions and extinctions. The range expansion of B. irregularis correlated well with the range contraction ofthe forest avifauna. Exceptionally high predation by snakes on bird-baited funnel traps occurred in areas where bird popu? lations had declined. Little or no snake predation occurred in areas with stable bird pop? ulations. Several factors have contributed to Boiga's success in decimating the avifauna on Guam. Although most common in forests, B. irregularis has occupied a variety of habitats on Guam, and few effective barriers to its dispersal exist. Prey refuges are present only in urban areas, on concrete or metal structures, and in the savanna. Boiga's nocturnal and arboreal habits and an apparent keen ability to locate prey, make roosting and nesting birds, eggs, and nestlings vulnerable. Besides birds, B. irregularis feeds on small mammals and lizards. By including the abundant small reptiles as a major component in its diet, Boiga has maintained high densities in forest and second-growth habitats while extermi- nating its more vulnerable prey. This is the first time a snake has been implicated as an agent of extinction.},

abstract = {HISTORICAL ecology contains various examples of how predators introduced onto islands by man have apparently exterminated native prey species(1-6). Conversely, a pioneering experiment(7) showed an increase in number of species with predator presence. Subsequent experiments have shown both increases and decreases in prey diversity(8-10). Here we investigate how predator introduction affects one aspect of prey diversity (number of species or species richness), and prey abundance, We ran a seven-year experiment on an entirely natural system of small islands, using the commonest local lizard as the predator and web spiders as prey. Lizard introduction caused rapid and devastating effects on spider diversity and abundance: within two years, islands onto which lizards had been introduced became almost identical to islands with natural lizard populations. The proportion of species becoming extinct was 12.6 times higher on 'lizard-introduction' islands than on islands without lizards. Locally common and rare species were both reduced by the introduction of lizards, but nearly all of the latter became permanently extinct.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim Understanding extinction on islands is critical for biodiversity conservation. Introduced predators are a major cause of island extinctions, but there have been few large-scale studies of the complexity of the effects of predators on island faunas, or how predation interacts with other factors. Using a large database of island mammal populations, we describe and explain patterns of island mammal extinc- tions as a function of introduced predators, life history and geography. Location Three hundred and twenty-three Australian islands. Methods We built a database of 934 island mammal populations, extinct and extant, including life history and ecology, island geography and the presence of introduced predators. To test predictors of extinction probability, we used gener- alized linear mixed models to control partially for phylogenetic non-independence, and decision trees to more fully explore interactive effects. Results The decision trees identified large mammals ({\textgreater} 2.7 kg) as having higher extinction probabilities than small species ({\textless} 2.7 kg). In large species, extinction patterns are consistent with island biogeography theory, with distance from the mainland being the primary predictor of extinction. For small species, the presence of introduced black rats is the primary predictor of extinction. As predicted by mesopredator suppression theory, extinction probabilities are lower on islandswith both black rats and a larger introduced predator (cats, foxes or dingoes), compared with islands with rats but no larger predator. Similarly, extinction probabilities are lower on islands with both a mid-sized (cats or foxes) and a larger (dingoes) predator, compared with islands with cats or foxes only. Main conclusions Island mammal extinctions result from complex interactions of introduced predators, island geography and prey biology. One conservation implication of our results is that eradication of introduced apex predators (cats, foxes or dingoes) from islands could precipitate the expansion of black rat popu- lations, potentially leading to extinction of native mammal species whose remain- ing populations are confined to islands.

abstract = {Predation is a major factor in ecology, evolution and conservation and thus its understanding is essential for insights into ecological processes and management of endangered populations of prey. Here we conducted a spatially (main island through to offshore islets) and temporally (1938-2005) extensive meta-analysis of published nest predation rates in New Zealand songbirds. We obtained information on nest predation rates from 79 populations (. n=. 4838 nests) of 26 species of songbirds belonging to 17 families. Nest predation rates increased from southwest to northeast and also across the last 60. years (by 15-25{\%} points in both cases). We identified a major impact of exotic mammalian predators. Nest predation was lowest in areas where no exotic predators were present (12.8{\%}), higher in areas with ongoing predator control (33.9{\%}), and highest in areas without control that had the full set of exotic and native nest predators (47.5{\%}). Surprisingly, nest predation rates were higher in introduced as compared to native species. Our analyses demonstrated that human-caused factors (introduced predators and prey) overrode factors such as nest type and habitat identified as important in predicting nest predation in North America and Europe previously. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Major abiotic disturbance can be an important factor influencing food-web dynamics, particularly in areas impacted by the recent increase in hurricane activity. We present a unique set of data on key food-web processes occurring on 10 small islands for three relatively calm years and then four subsequent years during which two hurricanes passed directly over the study site. Herbivory, as measured by leaf damage, was 3.2 times higher in the year after the first hurricane (2000) than in the previous year and was 1.7 times higher in the year after the second hurricane (2002) than in 2001. The effect of a top predator (the lizard, Anolis sagrei) on herbivory strengthened continuously after the first hurricane and overall was 2.4 times stronger during the disturbance period than before. Overall abundance of lizards was 30{\%} lower during the disturbance period than before, and abundances of web spiders and hymenopteran parasitoids were 66{\%} and 59{\%} lower, respectively. We suggest that increased herbivory observed on all islands was caused, at least in part, by the overall reduction in predation by both lizards and arthropods, whereas magnification of the lizard effect on herbivory was caused by reduced compensatory predation by arthropods.},

abstract = {1. Parasites affect interactions among species in food webs and should be considered in any analysis of the structure, dynamics or resilience of trophic networks. 2. However, the roles of individual parasite species, such as their importance as connectors within the network, and what factors determine these roles, are yet to be investigated. Here, we test the hypotheses that the species roles of trematode, cestode and nematode parasites in aquatic food webs are influenced by the type of definitive host they use, and also determined by their phylogenetic affiliations. 3. We quantified the network role of 189 helminth species from six highly resolved intertidal food webs. We focused on four measures of centrality (node degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvalue centrality), which characterize each parasite's position within the web, and on relative connectedness of a parasite species to taxa in its own module vs. other modules of the web (within-module degree and participation coefficient). 4. All six food webs displayed a significant modular structure, that is, they consisted of subsets of species interacting mostly with each other and less with species from other subsets. We demonstrated that the parasites themselves are not generating this modularity, though they contribute to intermodule connectivity. 5. Mixed-effects models revealed only a modest influence of the type of definitive host used (bird or fish) and of the web of origin on the different measures of parasite species roles. In contrast, the taxonomic affiliations of the parasites, included in the models as nested random factors, accounted for 37-93{\%} of the total variance, depending on the measure of species role. 6. Our findings indicate that parasites are important intermodule connectors and thus contribute to web cohesion. We also uncover a very strong phylogenetic signal in parasite species roles, suggesting that the role of any parasite species in a food web, including new invasive species, is to some extent predictable based solely on its taxonomic affiliations.},

abstract = {Abstract Resolving how complexity affects stability of natural communities is of key importance for predicting the consequences of biodiversity loss. Central to previous stability analysis has been the assumption that the resources of a consumer are substitutable. However, during their development, most species change diets; for instance, adults often use different resources than larvae or juveniles. Here, we show that such ontogenetic niche shifts are common in real ecological networks and that consideration of these shifts can alter which species are predicted to be at risk of extinction. Furthermore, niche shifts reduce and can even reverse the otherwise stabilizing effect of complexity. This pattern arises because species with several specialized life stages appear to be generalists at the species level but act as sequential specialists that are hypersensitive to resource loss. These results suggest that natural communities are more vulnerable to biodiversity loss than indicated by previous analyses.},

The great diversity of non-trophic interactions observed in nature has been poorly addressed by ecologists and largely excluded from network theory. Herein, we propose a conceptual framework that organises this diversity into three main functional classes defined by how they modify specific parameters in a dynamic food web model.

abstract = {We present a graph theoretic model of analysing food web structure called regular equivalence. Regular equivalence is a method for partitioning the species in a food web into "isotrophic classes" that play the same structural roles, even if they are not directly consuming the same prey or if they do not share the same predators. We contrast regular equivalence models, in which two species are members of the same trophic group if they have trophic links to the same set of other trophic groups, with structural equivalence models, in which species are equivalent if they are connected to the exact same other species. Here, the regular equivalence approach is applied to two published food webs: (1) a topological web (Malaysian pitcher plant insect food web) and (2) a carbon-flow web (St. Marks, Florida seagrass ecosystem food web). Regular equivalence produced a more satisfactory set of classes than did the structural approach, grouping basal taxa with other basal taxa and not with top predators. Regular equivalence models provide a way to mathematically formalize trophic position, trophic group and trophic niche. These models are part of a family of models that includes structural models used extensively by ecologists now. Regular equivalence models uncover similarities in trophic roles at a higher level of organization than do the structural models. The approach outlined is useful for measuring the trophic roles of species in food web models, measuring similarity in trophic relations of two or more species, comparing food webs over time and across geographic regions, and aggregating taxa into trophic groups that reduce the complexity of ecosystem feeding relations without obscuring network relationships. In addition, we hope the approach will prove useful in predicting the outcome of predator-prey interactions in experimental studies.},

abstract = {The concept of a group is ubiquitous in biology. It underlies classifications in evolution and ecology, including those used to describe phylogenetic levels, the habitat and functional roles of organisms in ecosystems. Surprisingly, this concept is not explicitly included in simple models for the structure of food webs, the ecological networks formed by consumer–resource interactions. We present here the simplest possible model based on groups, and show that it performs substantially better than current models at predicting the structure of large food webs. Our group-based model can be applied to different types of biological and non-biological networks, and for the first time merges in the same framework two important notions in network theory: that of compartments (sets of highly interacting nodes) and that of roles (sets of nodes that have similar interaction patterns). This model provides a basis to examine the significance of groups in biological networks and to develop more accurate models for ecological network structure. It is especially relevant at a time when a new generation of empirical data is providing increasingly large food webs. Few concepts in biology are so pervasive as that of a group. Since the work of Linnaeus more than 250 years ago, biologists have tried to classify organisms into species, species into genera, genera into families, and so on. In ecology, species have been grouped according to their habitat, such as benthic vs. pelagic species in marine environments, below-ground and canopy communities in tropical forests, autotrophs, primary consumers and detri-tivores, based on energy sources, omnivores, specialists, and generalists based on their diet breadth, to name a few examples of grouping species. Surprisingly, however, the concept of group has been largely left out from the construction of simple models for food web structure (Cohen et al. 1990; Williams {\&} Martinez 2000; Cattin et al. 2004; Allesina et al. 2008). Only Cattin et al. (2004) implicitly consider that similar predators act in a similar way. To date no model addressed the presence of groups explicitly. These stochastic models provide a way to construct with a few simple rules {\^{O}}realistic{\~{O}} food webs or networks describing {\^{O}}who eats whom{\~{O}} in an ecosystem. The simplest models are motivated by a few ecological principles and require only two parameters, the total number of species, or species richness, and the total number of connections, or connectance, in the network. The recent comparisons of these models based on likelihoods have therefore consid-ered the same number of parameters (Allesina et al. 2008). However, the use of likelihoods opens the door for more general comparisons among models of varying complexity based on information criteria. We introduce here network models based on the concept of groups and compare for the first time, models with a different number of parameters. We show that dividing species into groups yields critical information for building better models of food web structure, especially for large networks. In all the simple models of food web structure proposed so far, species are ranked into a one-dimensional hierarchy with this ranking providing the basis to establish species{\~{O}} interactions (Cohen et al. 1990; Williams {\&} Martinez 2000; Cattin et al. 2004; Allesina et al. 2008). For example, in the cascade model (Cohen et al. 1990), a species can prey with a given probability upon any species whose position in the ranking is lower, but cannot prey upon those with higher},

abstract = {In natural communities, species and their interactions are often organized as nonrandom networks, showing distinct and repeated complex patterns. A prevalent, but poorly explored pattern is ecological modularity, with weakly interlinked subsets of species (modules), which, however, internally consist of strongly connected species. The importance of modularity has been discussed for a long time, but no consensus on its prevalence in ecological networks has yet been reached. Progress is hampered by inadequate methods and a lack of large datasets. We analyzed 51 pollination networks including almost 10,000 species and 20,000 links and tested for modularity by using a recently developed simulated annealing algorithm. All networks with {\textgreater}150 plant and pollinator species were modular, whereas networks with {\textless}50 species were never modular. Both module number and size increased with species number. Each module includes one or a few species groups with convergent trait sets that may be considered as coevolutionary units. Species played different roles with respect to modularity. However, only 15{\%} of all species were structurally important to their network. They were either hubs (i.e., highly linked species within their own module), connectors linking different modules, or both. If these key species go extinct, modules and networks may break apart and initiate cascades of extinction. Thus, species serving as hubs and connectors should receive high conservation priorities.},

abstract = {The loss of interactions from mutualistic networks could foreshadow both plant and animal species extinctions. Yet, the characteristics of interactions that predispose them to disruption are largely unknown. We analyzed 12 pollination webs from isolated hills ("sierras"), in Argentina, ranging from tens to thousands of hectares. We found evidence of nonrandom loss of interactions with decreasing sierra size. Low interaction frequency and high specialization between interacting partners contributed additively to increase the vulnerability of interactions to disruption. Interactions between generalists in the largest sierras were ubiquitous across sierras, but many of them lost their central structural role in the smallest sierras. Thus, particular configurations of interaction networks, along with unique ecological relations and evolutionary pathways, could be lost forever after habitat reduction.},

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

abstract = {Interactions among species drive the ecological and evolutionary processes in ecological communities. These interactions are effectively key components of biodiversity. Studies that use a network approach to study the structure and dynamics of communities of interacting species have revealed many patterns and associated processes. Historically these studies were restricted to trophic interactions, although network approaches are now used to study a wide range of interactions, including for example the reproductive mutualisms. However, each interaction type remains studied largely in isolation from others. Merging the various interaction types within a single integrative framework is necessary if we want to further our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of communities. Dividing the networks up is a methodological convenience as in the field the networks occur together in space and time and will be linked by shared species. Herein, we outline a conceptual framework for studying networks composed of more than one type of interaction, highlighting key questions and research areas that would benefit from their study.},

abstract = {Most parasites infect multiple hosts, but what factors determine the range of hosts a given parasite can infect? Understanding the broad scale determinants of parasite distributions across host lineages is important for predicting pathogen emergence in new hosts and for estimating pathogen diversity in understudied host species. In this study, we used a new data set on 793 parasite species reported from free-ranging populations of 64 carnivore species to examine the factors that influence parasite sharing between host species. Our results showed that parasites are more commonly shared between phylogenetically related host species pairs. Additionally, host species with higher similarity in biological traits and greater geographic range overlap were also more likely to share parasite species. Of three measures of phylogenetic relatedness considered here, the number divergence events that separated host species pairs most strongly influenced the likelihood of parasite sharing. We also showed that viruses and helminths tend to infect carnivore hosts within more restricted phylogenetic ranges than expected by chance. Overall, our results underscore the importance of host evolutionary history in determining parasite host range, even when simultaneously considering other factors such as host ecology and geographic distribution.},

abstract = {Abstract Although parasites represent an important component of ecosystems, few field and theoretical studies have addressed the structure of parasites in food webs. We evaluate the structure of parasitic links in an extensive salt marsh food web, with a new model distinguishing parasitic links from non-parasitic links among free-living species. The proposed model is an extension of the niche model for food web structure, motivated by the potential role of size (and related metabolic rates) in structuring food webs. The proposed extension captures several properties observed in the data, including patterns of clustering and nestedness, better than does a random model. By relaxing specific assumptions, we demonstrate that two essential elements of the proposed model are the similarity of a parasite's hosts and the increasing degree of parasite specialization, along a one-dimensional niche axis. Thus, inverting one of the basic rules of the original model, the one determining consumers' generality appears critical. Our results support the role of size as one of the organizing principles underlying niche space and food web topology. They also strengthen the evidence for the non-random structure of parasitic links in food webs and open the door to addressing questions concerning the consequences and origins of this structure.},

@article{Lafferty2008,
abstract = {Parasitism is the most common consumer strategy among organisms, yet only recently has there been a call for the inclusion of infectious disease agents in food webs. The value of this effort hinges on whether parasites affect food-web properties. Increasing evidence suggests that parasites have the potential to uniquely alter food-web topology in terms of chain length, connectance and robustness. In addition, parasites might affect food-web stability, interaction strength and energy flow. Food-web structure also affects infectious disease dynamics because parasites depend on the ecological networks in which they live. Empirically, incorporating parasites into food webs is straightforward. We may start with existing food webs and add parasites as nodes, or we may try to build food webs around systems for which we already have a good understanding of infectious processes. In the future, perhaps researchers will add parasites while they construct food webs. Less clear is how food-web theory can accommodate parasites. This is a deep and central problem in theoretical biology and applied mathematics. For instance, is representing parasites with complex life cycles as a single node equivalent to representing other species with ontogenetic niche shifts as a single node? Can parasitism fit into fundamental frameworks such as the niche model? Can we integrate infectious disease models into the emerging field of dynamic food-web modelling? Future progress will benefit from interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and infectious disease biologists.},

For each node, we have included additional information such as taxonomy, life history, residency, and vagility. Further, for each link, we define a specific interaction type. We present the data and metadata in the system-neutral format standardized by R. F. Hechinger and colleagues, and thus we recognize variables that are not represented in our data set but may be added by further study.},

abstract = {Biological and technological networks contain patterns, termed network motifs, which occur far more often than in randomized networks. Network motifs were suggested to be elementary building blocks that carry out key functions in the network. It is of interest to understand how network motifs combine to form larger structures. To address this, we present a systematic approach to define "motif generalizations": families of motifs of different sizes that share a common architectural theme. To define motif generalizations, we first define "roles" in a subgraph according to structural equivalence. For example, the feedforward loop triad--a motif in transcription, neuronal, and some electronic networks--has three roles: an input node, an output node, and an internal node. The roles are used to define possible generalizations of the motif. The feedforward loop can have three simple generalizations, based on replicating each of the three roles and their connections. We present algorithms for efficiently detecting motif generalizations. We find that the transcription networks of bacteria and yeast display only one of the three generalizations, the multi-output feedforward generalization. In contrast, the neuronal network of C. elegans mainly displays the multi-input generalization. Forward-logic electronic circuits display a multi-input, multi-output hybrid. Thus, networks which share a common motif can have very different generalizations of that motif. Using mathematical modeling, we describe the information processing functions of the different motif generalizations in transcription, neuronal, and electronic networks.},

abstract = {Despite a strong current interest in ecological networks, the bulk of studies are static descriptions of the structure of networks, and very few analyze their temporal dynamics. Yet, understanding network dynamics is important in order to relate network patterns to ecological processes. We studied the day-to-day dynamics of an arctic pollination interaction network over two consecutive seasons. First, we found that new species entering the network tend to interact with already well-connected species, although there are deviations from this trend due, for example, to morphological mismatching between plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping phenophases of plant and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics provides a mechanistic explanation for previously reported network patterns such as the heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across species. Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and phenoph...},

abstract = {Several of the most ambitious theories in ecology describe food webs that document the structure of strong and weak trophic links that is responsible for ecological dynamics among diverse assemblages of species. Early mechanism-based theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and several properties that are independent of species richness. This theory was overturned by empirical studies that found food webs to be much more complex, but these studies did not provide mechanistic explanations for the complexity. Here we show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void by successfully predicting key structural properties of the most complex and comprehensive food webs in the primary literature. These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species number and connectance, our 'niche model' extends the existing 'cascade model and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche.},

The food web statistics (chain length; predator/prey ratio; fraction of top, intermediate, and bottom species; and rigid circuits) are scaling in the sense that they remain roughly invariant over a wide range of data resolution.

abstract = {Complex networks of interactions are ubiquitous and are particularly important in ecological communities, in which large numbers of species exhibit negative (for example, competition or predation) and positive (for example, mutualism) interactions with one another. Nestedness in mutualistic ecological networks is the tendency for ecological specialists to interact with a subset of species that also interact with more generalist species. Recent mathematical and computational analysis has suggested that such nestedness increases species richness. By examining previous results and applying computational approaches to 59 empirical data sets representing mutualistic plant–pollinator networks, we show that this statement is incorrect. A simpler metric—the number of mutualistic partners a species has—is a much better predictor of individual species survival and hence, community persistence. Nestedness is, at best, a secondary covariate rather than a causative factor for biodiversity in mutualistic communities. Analysis of complex networks should be accompanied by analysis of simpler, underpinning mechanisms that drive multiple higher-order network properties.},

abstract = {While the recent inclusion of parasites into food-web studies has highlighted the role of parasites as consumers, there is accumulating evidence that parasites can also serve as prey for predators. Here we investigated empirical patterns of pre- dation on parasites and their relationships with parasite transmission in eight topological food webs representing marine and freshwater ecosystems. Within each food web, we examined links in the typical predator – prey sub web as well as the predator – parasite sub web, i.e. the quadrant of the food web indicating which predators eat parasites. Most predator – parasite links represented ‘ concomitant predation ' (consumption and death of a parasite along with the prey/host; 58 – 72{\%}), followed by ‘ trophic transmission ' (predator feeds on infected prey and becomes infected; 8 – 32{\%}) and predation on free-living parasite life-cycle stages (4 – 30{\%}). Parasite life-cycle stages had, on average, between 4.2 and 14.2 predators. Among the food webs, as predator richness increased, the number of links exploited by trophically transmitted parasites increased at about the same rate as did the number of links where these stages serve as prey. On the whole, our analyses suggest that predation on parasites has important consequences for both predators and parasites, and food web structure. Because our analysis is solely based on topological webs, determining the strength of these interactions is a promising avenue for future research.},

abstract = {In natural ecosystems, species are linked by feeding interactions that determine energy fluxes and create complex food webs. The stability of these food webs enables many species to coexist and to form diverse ecosystems. Recent theory finds predator-prey body-mass ratios to be critically important for food-web stability. However, the mechanisms responsible for this stability are unclear. Here we use a bioenergetic consumer-resource model to explore how and why only particular predator-prey body-mass ratios promote stability in tri-trophic (three-species) food chains. We find that this 'persistence domain' of ratios is constrained by bottom-up energy availability when predators are much smaller than their prey and by enrichment-driven dynamics when predators are much larger. We also find that 97{\%} of the tri-trophic food chains across five natural food webs exhibit body-mass ratios within the predicted persistence domain. Further analyses of randomly rewired food webs show that body mass and allometric degree distributions in natural food webs mediate this consistency. The allometric degree distributions hold that the diversity of species' predators and prey decreases and increases, respectively, with increasing species' body masses. Our results demonstrate how simple relationships between species' body masses and feeding interactions may promote the stability of complex food webs.},

To date, many dynamic studies of food-web behaviour--both empirical and theoretical--have focused on smaller sub-webs, called trophic modules, because these modules are more tractable experimentally and analytically than whole food webs. The question remains to what degree studies of trophic modules are relevant to infer the persistence of entire food webs. Four trophic modules have received particular attention in the literature: tri-trophic food chains, omnivory, exploitative competition, and apparent competition. Here, we integrate analysis of these modules' dynamics in isolation with those of whole food webs to directly assess the appropriateness of scaling from modules to food webs. We find that there is not a direct, one-to-one, relationship between the relative persistence of modules in isolation and their effect on persistence of an entire food web. Nevertheless, we observe that those modules which are most commonly found in empirical food webs are those that confer the greatest community persistence. As a consequence, we demonstrate that there may be significant dynamic justifications for empirically-observed food-web structure.},

Interactions among co-infecting parasites may have important consequences for disease severity, transmission and community-level responses to pertur- bations. However, our current view of parasite interactions in nature comes primarily from observational studies, which may be unreliable at detecting interactions. We performed a perturbation experiment in wild mice, by using an anthelminthic to suppress nematodes, and monitored the con- sequences for other parasite species. Overall, these parasite communities were remarkably stable to perturbation. Only one non-target parasite species responded to deworming, and this response was temporary: we found strong, but short-lived, increases in the abundance of Eimeria protozoa, which share an infection site with the dominant nematode species, suggesting local, dynamic competition. These results, providing a rare and clear exper- imental demonstration of interactions between helminths and co-infecting parasites in wild vertebrates, constitute an important step towards under- standing the wider consequences of similar drug treatments in humans and animals.},

abstract = {Patterns of host-parasite association are poorly understood in tropical forests. While we typically observe only snapshots of the diverse assemblages and interactions under variable conditions, there is a desire to make inferences about prevalence and host-specificity patterns. We studied the interaction of ticks with non-volant small mammals in forests of Borneo. We inferred the probability of species interactions from individual-level data in a multi-level Bayesian model that incorporated environmental covariates and advanced estimates for rarely observed species through model averaging. We estimated the likelihood of observing particular interaction frequencies under field conditions and a scenario of exhaustive sampling and examined the consequences for inferring host specificity. We recorded a total of 13 different tick species belonging to the five genera Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Ixodes, and Rhipicephalus from a total of 37 different host species (Rodentia, Scandentia, Carnivora, Soricidae) on 237 out of 1,444 host individuals. Infestation probabilities revealed most variation across host species but less variation across tick species with three common rat and two tree shrew species being most heavily infested. Host species identity explained ca. 75 {\%} of the variation in infestation probability and another 8-10 {\%} was explained by local host abundance. Host traits and site-specific attributes had little explanatory power. Host specificity was estimated to be similarly low for all tick species, which were all likely to infest 34-37 host species if exhaustively sampled. By taking into consideration the hierarchical organization of individual interactions that may take place under variable conditions and that shape host-parasite networks, we can discern uncertainty and sampling bias from true interaction frequencies, whereas network attributes derived from observed values may lead to highly misleading results. Multi-level approaches may help to move this field towards inferential approaches for understanding mechanisms that shape the strength and dynamics in ecological networks.},

abstract = {Biotic interactions have been considered as an important factor to be included in species distribution modelling, but little is known about how different types of interaction or different strategies for modelling affect model performance. This study compares different methods for including interspecific interactions in distribution models for bees, their brood parasites, and the plants they pollinate. Host–parasite interactions among bumble bees (genus Bombus: generalist pollinators and brood parasites) and specialist plant–pollinator interactions between Centris bees and Krameria flowers were used as case studies. We used 7 different modelling algorithms available in the BIOMOD R package. For Bombus, the inclusion of interacting species distributions generally increased model predictive accuracy. The improvement was better when the interacting species was included with its raw distribution rather than with its modeled suitability. However, incorporating the distributions of non-interacting species sometimes resulted in similarly increased model accuracy despite their being no significance of any interaction for the distribution. For the Centris-Krameria system the best strategy for modelling biotic interactions was to include the interacting species model-predicted values. However, the results were less consistent than those for Bombus species, and most models including biotic interactions showed no significant improvement over abiotic models. Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that biotic interactions can be important in structuring species distributions at regional scales. However, correlations between species distributions are not necessarily indicative of interactions. Therefore, choosing the correct biotic information, based on biological and ecological knowledge, is critical to improve the accuracy of species distribution models and forecast distribution change.},

abstract = {Research on the role of top–down (predation) and bottom–up (food) effects in food webs has led to the understanding that the variability of these effects in space and time is a fundamental feature of natural systems. Consequently, our measurement tools must allow us to evaluate the effects from a dynamical perspective. A population-dynamics approach may be appropriate to the task. More specifically, because food and predators both affect birth rate, birth rate dynamics may be a key to understanding their impact on the population of interest. Based on the Edmondson–Paloheimo model for birth rate, we propose a new population metric to assess the relative strength of top–down vs bottom–up effects. The metric is the ratio of contributions of changes in proportion of adults and fecundity to change in birth rate. Proportion of adults reflects a top–down effect (predators are assumed to be size-selective), fecundity reflects a bottom–up effect, and birth rate appears as a common currency with which to compare the former and the latter. Using microcosm experiments and computer simulations on the cladoceran Daphnia, we calibrate the metric and show that, in both types of tests, the ratio of contributions is typically 0.5–0.7 under a strong bottom–up effect and 2.0–2.2 under a strong top–down effect. This provides experimental evidence that the ratio of contributions may allow one to distinguish a strong top–down effect from a strong bottom–up effect.},

abstract = {The rich fossil record of equids has made them a model for evolutionary processes. Here we present a 1.12-times coverage draft genome from a horse bone recovered from permafrost dated to approximately 560-780 thousand years before present (kyr BP). Our data represent the oldest full genome sequence determined so far by almost an order of magnitude. For comparison, we sequenced the genome of a Late Pleistocene horse (43 kyr BP), and modern genomes of five domestic horse breeds (Equus ferus caballus), a Przewalski's horse (E. f. przewalskii) and a donkey (E. asinus). Our analyses suggest that the Equus lineage giving rise to all contemporary horses, zebras and donkeys originated 4.0-4.5 million years before present (Myr BP), twice the conventionally accepted time to the most recent common ancestor of the genus Equus. We also find that horse population size fluctuated multiple times over the past 2 Myr, particularly during periods of severe climatic changes. We estimate that the Przewalski's and domestic horse populations diverged 38-72 kyr BP, and find no evidence of recent admixture between the domestic horse breeds and the Przewalski's horse investigated. This supports the contention that Przewalski's horses represent the last surviving wild horse population. We find similar levels of genetic variation among Przewalski's and domestic populations, indicating that the former are genetically viable and worthy of conservation efforts. We also find evidence for continuous selection on the immune system and olfaction throughout horse evolution. Finally, we identify 29 genomic regions among horse breeds that deviate from neutrality and show low levels of genetic variation compared to the Przewalski's horse. Such regions could correspond to loci selected early during domestication.},

abstract = {A general prediction from simple metapopulation models is that spatially synchronized forcing can spatially synchronize population dynamics and destabilize metapopulations. In contrast, spatially asynchronous forcing is predicted to decrease population synchrony and promote temporal stability and population persistence, especially in the presence of dispersal. Only recently have studies begun to experimentally address these predictions. Moreover, few studies have experimentally examined how such processes operate in the context of competition communities. Stabilizing processes may continue to operate when placed within a metacommunity context with multiple competing consumers but only at low to intermediate levels of dispersal. High dispersal rates can reverse these predictions and lead to destabilization. We tested this under controlled conditions using an experimental aquatic system composed of three competing species of zooplankton. Metacommunities experienced different levels of dispersal and environmental forcing in the form of spatially synchronous or asynchronous pH perturbations. We found support that dispersal can have contrasting effects on population stability depending on the degree to which population dynamics were synchronized in space. Dispersal under synchronous forcing or no forcing had either neutral of positive effects on spatial population synchrony of all three zooplankton species. In these treatments, dispersal reduced population stability at the local and metapopulation levels for two of three species. In contrast, asynchronously varying environments reduced population synchrony relative to unforced systems, regardless of dispersal level. In these treatments, dispersal enhanced temporal stability and persistence of populations not by reducing population synchrony but by enhancing population minima and spatial averaging of abundances. High dispersal rates under asynchronous forcing reduced the abundance of one species, consistent with increasing regional competition and general metacommunity theory. However, no effects on its stability or persistence were observed. Our work highlights the context-dependent effects of dispersal on population dynamics in varying environments.},

abstract = {Understanding how diversity interacts with energy supply is of broad ecological interest. Most studies to date have investigated patterns within trophic levels, reflecting a lack of food webs which include information on energy flow. We added parasites to a published marine energy-flow food web, to explore whether parasite diversity is correlated with energy flow to host taxa. Parasite diversity was high with 36 parasite taxa affecting 40 of the 51 animal taxa. Adding parasites increased the number of trophic links per species, trophic link strength, connectance, and food chain lengths. There was evidence of an asymptotic relationship between energy flowing through a food chain and parasite diversity, although there were clear outliers. High parasite diversity was associated with host taxa which were highly connected within the food web. This suggests that energy flow through a taxon may favour parasite diversity, up to a maximal value. The evolutionary and energetic basis for that limitation is of key interest in understanding the basis for parasite diversity in natural food webs and thus their role in food web dynamics},

abstract = {The diversity of symbionts (commensals, mutualists or parasites) that share the same host species may depend on opportunities and constraints on host exploitation associated with host phenotype or environment. Various host traits may differently influence host accessibility and within-host population growth of each symbiont species, or they may determine the outcome of within-host interactions among coexisting species. In turn, phenotypic diversity of a host species may promote divergent exploitation strategies among its symbiotic organisms. We studied the distribution of two feather mite species, Proctophyllodes sylviae and Trouessartia bifurcata, among blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla wintering in southern Spain during six winters. The host population included migratory and sedentary individuals, which were unequally distributed between two habitat types (forests and shrublands). Visual mite counts showed that both mite species often coexisted on sedentary blackcaps, but were seldom found together on migratory blackcaps. Regardless of host habitat, Proctophyllodes were highly abundant and Trouessartia were scarce on migratory blackcaps, but the abundance of both mite species converged in intermediate levels on sedentary blackcaps. Coexistence may come at a cost for Proctophyllodes, whose load decreased when Trouessartia was present on the host (the opposite was not true). Proctophyllodes load was positively correlated with host wing length (wings were longer in migratory blackcaps), while Trouessartia load was positively correlated to uropygial gland size (sedentary blackcaps had bigger glands), which might render migratory and sedentary blackcaps better hosts for Proctophyllodes and Trouessartia, respectively. Our results draw a complex scenario for mite co-existence in the same host species, where different mite species apparently take advantage of, or are constrained by, divergent host phenotypic traits. This expands our understanding of bird-mite interactions, which are usually viewed as less dynamic in relation to variation in host phenotype, and emphasizes the role of host phenotypic divergence in the diversification of symbiotic organisms.

We built model food webs with different levels of richness and connectance, and used a bioenergetic model to project the dynamics of species biomasses. Further, we developed appropriate expressions for the dynamics of bioaccumulated and environmental pollutants. We additionally analyzed attributes of organisms' and communities as determinants of species persistence (stability). We found that the positive effect of complexity on stability was enhanced as pollutant stress increased. Additionally we showed that the number of basal species and the maximum trophic level shape the complexity–stability relationship in polluted systems, and that in-degree of consumers determines species extinction in polluted environments. Our study indicates that the form of biodiversity and the complexity of interaction networks are essential to understand and project the effects of pollution and other ecosystem threats.},

Yet, it is rarely recognised that such 'key hosts' can arise through disparate mechanisms, potentially requiring different approaches for control. We identify three distinct, but not mutually exclusive, processes that underlie host species heterogeneity: infection prevalence, population abundance and infectiousness. We construct a theoretical framework to isolate the role of each process from ecological data and to explore the outcome of different control approaches. Applying this framework to data on 11 gastrointestinal parasites in small mammal communities across the eastern United States reveals variation not only in the magnitude of transmission asymmetries among host species but also in the processes driving heterogeneity. These differences influence the efficiency by which different control strategies reduce transmission. Identifying and tailoring interventions to a specific type of key host may therefore enable more effective management of multihost parasites.},

Only models in which plant enemy similarity declines rapidly with defence similarity support greater species richness than models of neutral drift. In contrast, a wide range of enemy host breadths result in spatial dispersion of defence traits, at both landscape and local scales, indicating that enemy-mediated competition may increase defence-trait diversity without enhancing species richness. Nevertheless, insect and pathogen host associations in Panama and Papua New Guinea demonstrate a potential to enhance plant species richness and defence-trait diversity comparable to strictly specialised enemies.},

I develop a simple model demonstrating how the opportunity for selection varies with interaction strength, and then use the relationship between the maximum value of the selection differential and the opportunity for selection (Arnold {\&} Wade 1984) to evaluate how selection differentials vary in relation to species interaction strength. This model predicts an initial deceleration and then an accelerating increase in the intensity of selection with increasing strength of antagonistic interactions and with decreasing strength of mutualistic interactions. Empirical data from several studies provide support for this model. These results further support an evolutionary mechanism for some striking patterns of evolutionary diversification including the latitudinal species gradient, and should be relevant to studies of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Populations on the edge of an expanding range are subject to unique evolutionary pressures acting on their life-history and dispersal traits. Empirical evidence and theory suggest that traits there can evolve rapidly enough to interact with ecological dynamics, potentially giving rise to accelerating spread. Nevertheless, which of several evolutionary mechanisms drive this interaction between evolution and spread remains an open question. We propose an integrated theoretical framework for partitioning the contributions of different evolutionary mechanisms to accelerating spread, and we apply this model to invasive cane toads in northern Australia. In doing so, we identify a previously unrecognised evolutionary process that involves an interaction between life-history and dispersal evolution during range shift. In roughly equal parts, life-history evolution, dispersal evolution and their interaction led to a doubling of distance spread by cane toads in our model, highlighting the potential importance of multiple evolutionary processes in the dynamics of range expansion.},

abstract = {Humans are altering the global distributional ranges of plants, while their co-evolved herbivores are frequently left behind. Native herbivores often colonise non-native plants, potentially reducing invasion success or causing economic loss to introduced agricultural crops. We developed a predictive model to forecast novel interactions and verified it with a data set containing hundreds of observed novel plant-insect interactions. Using a food network of 900 native European butterfly and moth species and 1944 native plants, we built an herbivore host-use model. By extrapolating host use from the native herbivore-plant food network, we accurately forecasted the observed novel use of 459 non-native plant species by native herbivores. Patterns that governed herbivore host breadth on co-evolved native plants were equally important in determining non-native hosts. Our results make the forecasting of novel herbivore communities feasible in order to better understand the fate and impact of introduced plants.},

abstract = {A key question in predicting responses to anthropogenic climate change is: how quickly can species adapt to different climatic conditions? Here, we take a phylogenetic approach to this question. We use 17 time-calibrated phylogenies representing the major tetrapod clades (amphibians, birds, crocodilians, mammals, squamates, turtles) and climatic data from distributions of {\textgreater}500 extant species. We estimate rates of change based on differences in climatic variables between sister species and estimated times of their splitting. We compare these rates to predicted rates of climate change from 2000 to 2100. Our results are striking: matching projected changes for 2100 would require rates of niche evolution that are {\textgreater}10000 times faster than rates typically observed among species, for most variables and clades. Despite many caveats, our results suggest that adaptation to projected changes in the next 100years would require rates that are largely unprecedented based on observed rates among vertebrate species.},

abstract = {The range of resources that a species uses (i.e. its niche breadth) might determine the geographical area it can occupy, but consensus on whether a niche breadth–range size relationship generally exists among species has been slow to emerge. The validity of this hypothesis is a key question in ecology in that it proposes a mechanism for commonness and rarity, and if true, may help predict species' vulnerability to extinction. We identified 64 studies that measured niche breadth and range size, and we used a meta-analytic approach to test for the presence of a niche breadth–range size relationship. We found a significant positive relationship between range size and environmental tolerance breadth (z = 0.49), habitat breadth (z = 0.45), and diet breadth (z = 0.28). The overall positive effect persisted even when incorporating sampling effects. Despite significant variability in the strength of the relationship among studies, the general positive relationship suggests that specialist species might be disproportionately vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change due to synergistic effects of a narrow niche and small range size. An understanding of the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that drive and cause deviations from this niche breadth–range size pattern is an important future research goal.},

Seed-traits have been shown to affect the final foraging decision but little is known about the decision process itself. Here, we first defined four sequential steps comprising the decision process of scatter-hoarding rodents: 1) upon encountering a seed, should it be ignored or manipulated; 2) if manipulated, should it be eaten in situ or removed elsewhere; 3) upon removal, how far away should it be carried; and finally 4) whether to eat or cache the removed seed. Using experimental seeds with controlled differences in size, tannin and nutrient content, we evaluated how different traits influence each step in this decision process. We found that different traits had distinct effects on each step. Seed size affected all four steps, while nutrient and tannin content primarily affected the first and third steps. By dissecting foraging behavior in relation to experimentally controlled seed-traits, we have created an effective framework within which to understand the unique relationship between scatter-hoarding rodents that both predate and disperse plant seeds.},

abstract = {Because species interactions are often context-dependent, abiotic factors such as temperature and biotic factors such as food quality may alter species interactions with potential consequences to ecosystem structure and function. For example, altered predator–prey interactions may influence the dynamics of trophic cascades, affecting net primary production. In a three-year field experiment, we manipulated a plant–grasshopper–spider food chain in mesic tallgrass prairie to investigate the effects of temperature and food quality on grasshopper performance, and to understand the direct and indirect tritrophic interactions that contribute to trophic cascades. Because spiders are active at cooler temperatures than grasshoppers in our system, we hypothesized that predator effects would be strongest in cooled treatments, and weakest in warmed treatments. Grasshopper spider interactions were highly context-dependent and varied significantly with food quality, temperature treatment and year. Spiders most often reduced grasshopper survival in the cooled and ambient temperature treatments, but had little to no effect on grasshopper survival in the warmed treatments, as hypothesized. In some years, plants compensated for grasshopper herbivory and trophic cascades were not observed despite significant effects of predators on grasshopper survival. However, in the year they were observed, trophic cascades only occurred in cooled treatments where predator effects on grasshoppers were strongest. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change will require an understanding of how temperature influences species interactions. Our results demonstrate that changes in daily temperature regimes can alter predator–prey interactions among arthropods with consequences for ecosystem processes such as primary production and the relative importance of top–down and bottom–up processes.},

abstract = {Apparent competition between prey is hypothesized to occur more frequently in environments with low densities of preferred prey, where predators are forced to forage for multiple prey items. In the arctic tundra, numerical and functional responses of predators to preferred prey (lemmings) affect the predation pressure on alternative prey (goose eggs) and predators aggregate in areas of high alternative prey density. Therefore, we hypothesized that predation risk on incidental prey (shorebird eggs) would increase in patches of high goose nest density when lemmings were scarce. To test this hypothesis, we measured predation risk on artificial shorebird nests in quadrats varying in goose nest density on Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada) across three summers with variable lemming abundance. Predation risk on artificial shorebird nests was positively related to goose nest density, and this relationship was strongest at low lemming abundance when predation risk increased by 600{\%} as goose nest density increased from 0 to 12 nests ha−1. Camera monitoring showed that activity of arctic foxes, the most important predator, increased with goose nest density. Our data support our incidental prey hypothesis; when preferred prey decrease in abundance, predator mediated apparent competition via aggregative response occurs between the alternative and incidental prey items.},

Our network is constructed from empirical observations of 11 animal groups in 12 habitats on farmland. We simulated sequential habitat removal scenarios: randomly; according to prior information; and with a genetic algorithm to identify best- and worst-case permutations of habitat loss. We identified two semi-natural habitats (waste ground and hedgerows together comprising {\textless} 5{\%} of the total area of the farm) as disproportionately important to the integrity of the overall network.

Here, we evaluate whether rates of biodiversity change have altered in recent decades in three European countries (Great Britain, Netherlands and Belgium) for plants and flower visiting insects. We compared four 20-year periods, comparing periods of rapid land-use intensification and natural habitat loss (1930–1990) with a period of increased conservation investment (post-1990). We found that extensive species richness loss and biotic homogenisation occurred before 1990, whereas these negative trends became substantially less accentuated during recent decades, being partially reversed for certain taxa (e.g. bees in Great Britain and Netherlands). These results highlight the potential to maintain or even restore current species assemblages (which despite past extinctions are still of great conservation value), at least in regions where large-scale land-use intensification and natural habitat loss has ceased.},

abstract = {The biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship is central in community ecology. Its drivers in competitive systems (sampling effect and functional complementarity) are intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to ecosystem functioning. Using a model of trophic community dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of ecosystem functioning, and generate a range of testable predictions. We find that, in addition to the number of species, the structure of their interactions needs to be accounted for to predict ecosystem productivity.},

abstract = {Understanding why food chains are relatively short in length has been an area of research and debate for decades. We tested if progressive changes in the nutritional content of arthropods with trophic position limit the availability of a key nutrient, lipid, for carnivores. Arthropods at higher trophic levels had progres-sively less lipid and more protein in their bodies compared with arthropods at lower trophic levels. The nutrients present in arthropod bodies were directly related to the nutrients that predators extracted when feeding on those arthropods. As a consequence, nutrient assimilation shifted from lipid-biased to protein-biased as arthropods ascended trophic levels from herbivores to secondary carnivores. Successive changes in the nutritional consequences of predation may ultimately set an upper limit on the number of trophic levels in arthropod communities. Further work is needed to examine the influence of lipid and other nutri-ents on food web traits in a range of ecosystems.},

abstract = {After much debate, there is an emerging consensus that the composition of many ecological communities is determined both by species traits, as proposed by niche theory, as well as by chance events. A critical question for ecology is, therefore, which attributes of species predict the dominance of deterministic or stochastic processes. We outline two hypotheses by which organism size could determine which processes structure ecological communities, and we test these hypotheses by comparing the community structure in bromeliad phytotelmata of three groups of organisms (bacteria, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrates) that encompass a 10 000-fold gradient in body size, but live in the same habitat. Bacteria had no habitat associations, as would be expected from trait-neutral stochastic processes, but still showed exclusion among species pairs, as would be expected from niche-based processes. Macroinvertebrates had strong habitat and species associations, indicating niche-based processes. Zooplankton, with body size between bacteria and macroinvertebrates, showed intermediate habitat associations. We concluded that a key niche process, habitat filtering, strengthened with organism size, possibly because larger organisms are both less plastic in their fundamental niches and more able to be selective in dispersal. These results suggest that the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes may be predictable from organism size.},

We used macroinvertebrate community data from 10 streams that varied independently in local ecological conditions and spatial proximity. Neutral theory predicts that similarity in communities will be negatively associated with distance between sites, while niche theory suggests that community similarity will be positively associated with similarity in local ecological conditions. Similarity in total invertebrate, grazer and predator assemblages showed negative relationships with distance and, for grazers and predators, positive relationships with local ecological conditions. However, the best model predicting community similarity in all three cases included aspects of both local ecological conditions and distance between sites. When assemblages were analysed according to dispersal ability, high-dispersal species were shown to be freely accessing all sites and community similarity was not well predicted by either local ecology or spatial separation. Assemblages of species with low and moderate dispersal ability were best predicted by combined models, including distance between sites and local ecological factors. The results suggest that the perceived dichotomy between neutral and local environmental processes in determining local patterns of diversity may not be useful. Neutral and niche processes structured these communities differentially depending on trophic level and species traits. We emphasize the potential for both dispersal processes and local environmental conditions to explain local patterns of diversity.},

abstract = {Local extinctions have cascading effects on ecosystem functions, yet little is known about the potential for the rapid evolutionary change of species in human-modified scenarios. We show that the functional extinction of large-gape seed dispersers in the Brazilian Atlantic forest is associated with the consistent reduction of the seed size of a keystone palm species. Among 22 palm populations, areas deprived of large avian frugivores for several decades present smaller seeds than nondefaunated forests, with negative consequences for palm regeneration. Coalescence and phenotypic selection models indicate that seed size reduction most likely occurred within the past 100 years, associated with human-driven fragmentation. The fast-paced defaunation of large vertebrates is most likely causing unprecedented changes in the evolutionary trajectories and community composition of tropical forests.},

abstract = {Human exploitation of marine ecosystems is more recent in oceanic than near shore regions, yet our understanding of human impacts on oceanic food webs is comparatively poor. Few records of species that live beyond the continental shelves date back more than 60 y, and the sheer size of oceanic regions makes their food webs difficult to study, even in modern times. Here, we use stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to study the foraging history of a generalist, oceanic predator, the Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis), which ranges broadly in the Pacific from the equator to near the Aleutian Islands. Our isotope records from modern and ancient, radiocarbon-dated bones provide evidence of over 3,000 y of dietary stasis followed by a decline of ca. 1.8‰ in $\delta$(15)N over the past 100 y. Fishery-induced trophic decline is the most likely explanation for this sudden shift, which occurs in genetically distinct populations with disparate foraging locations. Our isotope records also show that coincident with the apparent decline in trophic level, foraging segregation among petrel populations decreased markedly. Because variation in the diet of generalist predators can reflect changing availability of their prey, a foraging shift in wide-ranging Hawaiian petrel populations suggests a relatively rapid change in the composition of oceanic food webs in the Northeast Pacific. Understanding and mitigating widespread shifts in prey availability may be a critical step in the conservation of endangered marine predators such as the Hawaiian petrel.},

abstract = {Abstract.—Harsh conditions (e.g., mortality and stress) reduce population growth rates directly; secondarily, they may reduce the intensity of interactions between organisms. Near-exclusive fo- cus on the secondary effect of these forms of harshness has led ecologists to believe that they reduce the importance of ecological interactions, such as competition, and favor coexistence of even ecologically very similar species. By examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. Fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance, seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interac- tions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctua- tions create spatial or temporal niche opportunities. We argue that important diversity-promoting roles for harsh and fluctuating conditions depend on deviations from the assumptions of additive effects and linear dependencies most commonly found in ecological models. Such considerations imply strong roles for species interactions in the diversity of a community.},

abstract = {The traditional likelihood-based test for differences in multivariate dispersions is known to be sensitive to nonnormality. It is also impossible to use when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Many biological and ecological data sets have many variables, are highly skewed, and are zero-inflated. The traditional test and even some more robust alternatives are also unreasonable in many contexts where measures of dispersion based on a non-Euclidean dissimilarity would be more appropriate. Distance-based tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions, which can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, are proposed here. They rely on the rotational invariance of either the multivariate centroid or the spatial median to obtain measures of spread using principal coordinate axes. The tests are straightforward multivariate extensions of Levene's test, with P-values obtained either using the traditional F-distribution or using permutation of either least-squares or LAD residuals. Examples illustrate the utility of the approach, including the analysis of stabilizing selection in sparrows, biodiversity of New Zealand fish assemblages, and the response of Indonesian reef corals to an El Ni{\~{n}}o. Monte Carlo simulations from the real data sets show that the distance-based tests are robust and powerful for relevant alternative hypotheses of real differences in spread.},

Bizarrely, rats infected with the brain parasite Toxoplasma gondii approach the cat odors they typically avoid. Since the protozoan Toxoplasma requires the cat to sexually reproduce, this change in host behavior is thought to be a remarkable example of a parasite manipulating a mammalian host for its own benefit. Toxoplasma does not influence host response to non-feline predator odor nor does it alter behavior on olfactory, social, fear or anxiety tests, arguing for specific manipulation in the processing of cat odor. We report that Toxoplasma infection alters neural activity in limbic brain areas necessary for innate defensive behavior in response to cat odor. Moreover, Toxoplasma increases activity in nearby limbic regions of sexual attraction when the rat is exposed to cat urine, compelling evidence that Toxoplasma overwhelms the innate fear response by causing, in its stead, a type of sexual attraction to the normally aversive cat odor.},

abstract = {Null hypotheses entertain the possibility that nothing has happened, that a process has not occurred, or that change has not been produced by a cause of interest. Null hypotheses are reference points against which alternatives should be contrasted. They are used not only in statistics but in all sciences. “This hypothesis{\ldots}is{\ldots} characteristic of all experimentation” (Fisher 1935). In physics for example, an important null hypothesis of the post-Newtonian era was that time is a variable which is independent of all other factors. Modern physics is based upon the alternative hypothesis that time can be a function of space and relative velocities. Another famous null hypothesis, that the speed of light is independent of its direction, inspired the Michelson-Morley experiments, which failed to disprove it. An example in chemistry is that there is no molecular property unique to life, that any synthesis by protoplasm can be repeated in the test tube. Modern biochemistry has failed to disprove this null hypothesis. But the term null hypothesis sounds odd in reference to much of physics and chemistry. It is not found in textbooks nor is it used frequently in conversation about these disciplines. Though all sciences use null hypotheses in principle, the ‘atomistic'1 sciences of physics and chemistry often use them implicitly. In atomistic sciences, fundamental units are simple and quite similar to one another, and effects of phenomena are commonly so distinct that the null state of no effect does not need special recognition.},

This study considers what is being implicitly assumed about the mean-variance relationship in distance-based analyses - multivariate analyses based on a matrix of pairwise distances - and what the effect is of any misspecification of the mean-variance relationship. It is known that distance-based analyses make implicit assumptions that are typically out-of-step with what is observed in real data, which has major consequences. Potential consequences of this mean-variance misspecifiation are: confounding location and dispersion effects in ordinations; misleading results when trying to identify taxa in which an effect is expressed; failure to detect a multivariate effect unless it is expressed in high-variance taxa. Data transformation does not solve the problem. A solution is to use generalized linear models and their recent multivariate generalisations, which is shown here to have desirable properties.},

abstract = {Abstract Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The data focus on host features, because specific parasite traits are not consistently available across records. For this reason, the data set is intended as a flexible resource able to extend the principles of ecological niche modeling to the host–parasite system, providing researchers with the data to model parasite niches based on their distribution in host species and the associated host features. In this sense, the database offers a framework for testing general ecological, biogeographical, and phylogenetic hypotheses based on the identification of hosts as parasite habitat. Potential applications of the data set are, for example, the investigation of species–area relationships or the taxonomic distribution of host-specificity. The provided host–parasite list is that currently used by Fish Parasite Ecology Software Tool (FishPEST, http://purl.oclc.org/fishpest), which is a website that allows researchers to model several aspects of the relationships between fish parasites and their hosts.

abstract = {The importance of competition between similar species in driving community assembly is much debated. Recently, phylogenetic patterns in species composition have been investigated to help resolve this question: phylogenetic clustering is taken to imply environmental filtering, and phylogenetic overdispersion to indicate limiting similarity between species. We used experimental plant communities with random species compositions and initially even abundance distributions to examine the development of phylogenetic pattern in species abundance distributions. Where composition was held constant by weeding, abundance distributions became overdispersed through time, but only in communities that contained distantly related clades, some with several species (i.e., a mix of closely and distantly related species). Phylogenetic pattern in composition therefore constrained the development of overdispersed abundance distributions, and this might indicate limiting similarity between close relatives and facilitation/complementarity between distant relatives. Comparing the phylogenetic patterns in these communities with those expected from the monoculture abundances of the constituent species revealed that interspecific competition caused the phylogenetic patterns. Opening experimental communities to colonization by all species in the species pool led to convergence in phylogenetic diversity. At convergence, communities were composed of several distantly related but species-rich clades and had overdispersed abundance distributions. This suggests that limiting similarity processes determine which species dominate a community but not which species occur in a community. Crucially, as our study was carried out in experimental communities, we could rule out local evolutionary or dispersal explanations for the patterns and identify ecological processes as the driving force, underlining the advantages of studying these processes in experimental communities. Our results show that phylogenetic relations between species provide a good guide to understanding community structure and add a new perspective to the evidence that niche complementarity is critical in driving community assembly.},

abstract = {Researchers increasingly recognize the important role of mutualisms in structuring communities and view positive interactions in a community context rather than as simple pairwise interactions. Indirect effects, such as those that predators have on lower trophic levels, are a key process in community ecology. However, such top-down indirect effects have rarely been extended to mutualisms. Antagonists of one mutualist have the potential to negatively affect the second mutualist through negative effects on their partner, and the magnitude of such effects should vary with mutualism strength. Bumble bees are ecologically and economically important pollinators that are an ideal system to determine if such indirect effects play an important role in mutualisms. Bumble bees are attacked by an array of parasites and predators, and they interact with a range of plants that vary in their dependence on bumble bees for reproduction. We tested whether variation in parasitism rates by Nosema bombi, Crithidia bombi, and conopid flies correlated with reproduction of greenhouse-raised plants placed in the field. At multiple sites over two years, we studied four plant species that varied in reliance on bumble bees as pollinators. We found a consistent negative relationship between Nosema parasitism and measures of pollination for Trifolium pratense and Solanum carolinense, plant species with high bumble bee visitation, whereas Rudbeckia hirta and Daucus carota, plant species with generalized pollination, experienced no impacts of Nosema. However, both Crithidia and conopids showed inconsistent relationships with pollination service. Although these patterns are correlational, they provide evidence that parasites of bumble bees may have negative indirect effects on plants, and that mutualism strength can moderate the magnitude of such effects.},

abstract = {Extinction from habitat loss is the signature conservation problem of the twenty-first century. Despite its importance, estimating extinction rates is still highly uncertain because no proven direct methods or reliable data exist for verifying extinctions. The most widely used indirect method is to estimate extinction rates by reversing the species-area accumulation curve, extrapolating backwards to smaller areas to calculate expected species loss. Estimates of extinction rates based on this method are almost always much higher than those actually observed. This discrepancy gave rise to the concept of an 'extinction debt', referring to species 'committed to extinction' owing to habitat loss and reduced population size but not yet extinct during a non-equilibrium period. Here we show that the extinction debt as currently defined is largely a sampling artefact due to an unrecognized difference between the underlying sampling problems when constructing a species-area relationship (SAR) and when extrapolating species extinction from habitat loss. The key mathematical result is that the area required to remove the last individual of a species (extinction) is larger, almost always much larger, than the sample area needed to encounter the first individual of a species, irrespective of species distribution and spatial scale. We illustrate these results with data from a global network of large, mapped forest plots and ranges of passerine bird species in the continental USA; and we show that overestimation can be greater than 160{\%}. Although we conclude that extinctions caused by habitat loss require greater loss of habitat than previously thought, our results must not lead to complacency about extinction due to habitat loss, which is a real and growing threat.},

abstract = {Many different drivers, including productivity, ecosystem size, and disturbance, have been considered to explain natural variation in the length of food chains. Much remains unknown about the role of these various drivers in determining food chain length, and particularly about the mechanisms by which they may operate in terrestrial ecosystems, which have quite different ecological constraints than aquatic environments, where most food chain length studies have been thus far conducted. In this study, we tested the relative importance of ecosystem size and productivity in influencing food chain length in a terrestrial setting. We determined that (1) there is no effect of ecosystem size or productive space on food chain length; (2) rather, food chain length increases strongly and linearly with productivity; and (3) the observed changes in food chain length are likely achieved through a combination of changes in predator size, predator behavior, and consumer diversity along gradients in productivity. These results lend new insight into the mechanisms by which productivity can drive changes in food chain length, point to potential for systematic differences in the drivers of food web structure between terrestrial and aquatic systems, and challenge us to consider how ecological context may control the drivers that shape food chain length.},

abstract = {The degree of dietary generalism among consumers has important consequences for population, community, and ecosystem processes, yet the effects on consumer fitness of mixing food types have not been examined comprehensively. We conducted a meta-analysis of 161 peer-reviewed studies reporting 493 experimental manipulations of prey diversity to test whether dietmixing enhances consumer fitness based on the intrinsic nutritional quality of foods and consumer physiology. Averaged across studies, mixed diets conferred significantly higher fitness than the average of single-species diets, but not the best single prey species. More than half of individual experiments, however, showed maximal growth and reproduction on mixed diets, consistent with the predicted benefits of a balanced diet.Mixed diets including chemically defended prey were no better than the average prey type, opposing the prediction that a diverse diet dilutes toxins. Finally, mixed-model analysis showed that the effect of diet mixing was stronger for herbivores than for higher trophic levels. The generally weak evidence for the nutritional benefits of diet mixing in these primarily laboratory experiments suggests that diet generalism is not strongly favored by the inherent physiological benefits of mixing food types, but is more likely driven by ecological and environmental influences on consumer foraging},

abstract = {There is much concern that the functioning of ecosystems will be affected by human-induced changes in biodiversity, of which land-use change is the most important driver. However, changes in biodiversity may be only one of many pathways through which land use alters ecosystem functioning, and its importance relative to other pathways remains unclear. In particular, although biodiversity-ecosystem function research has focused primarily on grasslands, the increases in agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilization, irrigation) and grazing pressure that drive change in grasslands worldwide have been largely ignored. Here we show that long-term (27-year) manipulations of soil resource availability and sheep grazing intensity caused marked, consistent shifts in grassland plant functional composition and diversity, with cascading (i.e., causal chains of) direct, indirect, and interactive effects on multiple ecosystem functions. Resource availability exerted dominant control over above-ground net primary production (ANPP), both directly and indirectly via shifts in plant functional composition. Importantly, the effects of plant functional diversity and grazing intensity on ANPP shifted from negative to positive as agricultural inputs increased, providing strong evidence that soil resource availability modulates the impacts of plant diversity and herbivory on primary production. These changes in turn altered litter decomposition and, ultimately, soil carbon sequestration, highlighting the relevance of ANPP as a key integrator of ecosystem functioning. Our study reveals how human alterations of bottom-up (resources) and top-down (herbivory) forces together interact to control the functioning of grazing systems, the most extensive land use on Earth.},

abstract = {Human activities drive biotic homogenization (loss of regional diversity) of many taxa. However, whether species interaction networks (e.g., food webs) can also become homogenized remains largely unexplored. Using 48 quantitative parasitoid-host networks replicated through space and time across five tropical habitats, we show that deforestation greatly homogenized network structure at a regional level, such that interaction composition became more similar across rice and pasture sites compared with forested habitats. This was not simply caused by altered consumer and resource community composition, but was associated with altered consumer foraging success, such that parasitoids were more likely to locate their hosts in deforested habitats. Furthermore, deforestation indirectly homogenized networks in time through altered mean consumer and prey body size, which decreased in deforested habitats. Similar patterns were obtained with binary networks, suggesting that interaction (link) presence-absence data may be sufficient to detect network homogenization effects. Our results show that tropical agroforestry systems can support regionally diverse parasitoid-host networks, but that removal of canopy cover greatly homogenizes the structure of these networks in space, and to a lesser degree in time. Spatiotemporal homogenization of interaction networks may alter coevolutionary outcomes and reduce ecological resilience at regional scales, but may not necessarily be predictable from community changes observed within individual trophic levels.},

These fields are now starting to converge, and this fusion has the potential to improve our understanding of how environmental stressors modulate ecosystem processes and the supply of 'goods and services'. 2. Food web structure and dynamics can exert particularly strong influences on B-EF relations in fresh waters, as consumer-resource interactions (e.g. trophic cascades) are often more important than horizontal interactions within trophic levels. For instance, many freshwater food webs are size structured, with large organisms tending to occupy the higher trophic levels and often exerting powerful effects on ecosystem processes. However, because they are also vulnerable to perturbations, non-random losses of these large taxa can alter both food web structure and ecosystem functioning profoundly. 3. Recently, the focus of food web research has shifted away from exploring patterns, towards developing an understanding of processes (e.g. quantifying fluxes of individuals, biomass, energy, nutrients) and how the two interact. Many of the best-characterized food webs are from fresh waters, and these ecosystems are now being used to address some of the shortcomings of earlier B-EF studies. I have identified several key gaps in our current knowledge and highlighted potentially fruitful avenues of future B-EF and food web research. 4. A major challenge for this newly emerging research is to place it within a unified theoretical framework. The application of metabolic theory and ecological stoichiometry may help to achieve this goal by considering biological systems within the constraints imposed upon them by physical and chemical laws.},

abstract = {The objective of the present paper, using decomposer food webs as a tool, is to explore the levels of the ecological hierarchy (trophic groups, feeding guilds, species populations) at which reduction in complexity brings about significant changes in ecosystem performance. A review is given of various mini-ecosystem studies that have recently been conducted at the University of Jyvaskyla. It is hypothesized that the typical features of soils as a habitat, and the peculiarities of belowground food webs, such as the commonness of indirect interactions (mediated through abiotic resources) among the biota, together with the high frequency of polyphagy/omnivory among soil organisms, produce a diversity-ecosystem functioning relationship that is likely to differ from those of aquatic and aboveground food webs. Experiments showed that alterations in 'trophic levels' were reflected in Significant changes in decomposition processes, which, in turn, had substantial impact on primary production. Similarly, heterogeneity within 'trophic levels' was shown to be associated with increased growth of birch and pine seedlings. In contrast, species diversity within a feeding guild had little or no influence on ecosystem-level processes. However, the species-specific properties of individual taxa were shown to be more influential in affecting plant growth than species number per se. For example, the presence of an omnivorous enchytraeid species in the mini-ecosystems was observed to consistently be associated with high biomass production of tree seedlings. It is concluded that the so-called trophic dynamic models based on direct feeding interactions are of limited value in predicting the outcomes of interactions taking place belowground.},

The model comprised 41 functional groups (including the artificial food input). Comparing consumption and respiration to total system throughput suggests lower energy use in the fish farm, resulting in an accumulation of detritus. The production to total system throughput ratio was low due to the low efficiency of the modelled ecosystem. The connectance and system omnivory indexes were low, typical of a simple or immature food web in terms of structure and dynamics. Artificial food pellets provided energy and nutrients to sustain system function and generate a considerable reserve from which it can draw to meet unexpected perturbations.

Are concerns of a pollinator crisis exaggerated, and can we make do with better management of honeybee colonies? Two articles in this issue provide compelling answers to these questions. On page 1611, Burkle et al. demonstrate that native wild pollinators are declining ( 6 ). On page 1608, Garibaldi et al. show that managed honeybees cannot compensate for this loss ( 7 ).},

abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category-subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods - both sample-based and individual-based - allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates whether the floating island model is a plausible transoceanic mode of dispersal among small to medium-sized land vertebrates. The actual Atlantic Ocean served as a model of winds and currents velocity, and data were sampled from modern marine pilot charts in two areas of the ocean. The main objective was to quantify the number of days required for a floating island to cross three Paleogene water barriers, 50, 40 and 30 Mya, namely the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea as well as the Southeast Indian Ocean between Sundaland and the northern Australian Plate. Paleodistances and ancient circulation patterns of winds and currents are known in each region. It is proposed that paleowinds (not paleocurrents), and its effect on floating objects, were the key accelerating force of floating islands' velocity. In the most conservative scenario, the Paleogene Atlantic oceanic barrier could have been crossed westerly by a floating island in 7.7 days at 50 Mya, 10.8 days at 40 Mya and 14.7 days at 30 Mya; the Paleogene Caribbean Sea from South to North America could have been surmounted northerly in 18.2 days at 50 Mya, 16.6 days at 40 Mya and 15.1 days at 30 Mya; finally, the Southeast Indian Ocean from Australia to Sundaland could have been crossed northerly in 25.6 days at 50 Mya, 19.5 days at 40 Mya and 12.2 days at 30 Mya. There are many physical, physiological and behavioral constraints to transoceanic migrations. Such migrations can be considered as potentially successful however if it is shown that the journey did not exceed the survival limit of a given genetically viable group of animals. Metabolic studies involving survival limits to water deprivation suggest that proposed scenarios are plausible for small to medium size mammals and most land reptiles. These studies also suggest that migrating groups were probably preadapted in their original habitats (before the oceanic journey) to some degree of temporary dehydration and therefore to strong or moderate seasonal variations in water and food availability in order to survive the transoceanic event. Considering for example, the origin of the South American platyrrhine monkeys and caviomorph rodents, respective ancestors of these mammal groups probably lived in habitats with definite dry and rainy seasons. This conclusion implies that the survival limit of both platyrrhines and rodents ancestors ranged between 10 and 15 days, an assumption related to the transoceanic scenarios presented here but nevertheless compatible with dehydration studies. From the tectonic perspective, when plates are moving rapidly (27-55 mm/yr), the number of days a floating island needs to cross an oceanic water barrier is doubled every 20 My when these plates are distancing each other (e.g. South America-Africa) or fractioned by two every 20 My when the plates are approaching each other (e.g. Australia towards Southeast Asia). An additional interesting point of the model is its applicability to other epochs and other water barriers.},

abstract = {Intertidal mussel species often provide a secondary substrate for competitively inferior species, while excluding them from the primary substrate. To evaluate the net effect, we conducted field experiments that specifically focused on interactions between mussels Septifer virgatus (Mieg- mann) and algae species. Mussels affected the abundance of 7 algal species differentially, with effects being positive, neutral, or negative. The red alga Porphyra yezoensis grew more abundantly on mussel shells than on rock surfaces. Mussels facilitated recruitment intensity of this species, resulting in increased adult cover on the shells. In contrast, the green alga Monostroma angicava grew less abundantly on mussel shells than on rock surfaces. Mussel shells did not modify recruit- ment intensity of this alga, but did inhibit its frond growth, and would thus seem to reduce adult cover. Modifications of grazer density by the mussels did not affect either of these algae species. The results indicate that the net effect of mussels on competitively inferior species is not grazer-mediated, and varies from species to species.},

abstract = {An inverse relationship between body size and advertisement call frequency has been found in several frog species. However, the generalizability of this relation- ship across different clades and across a large distribution of species remains underexplored. We investigated this relationship in a large sample of 136 species belonging to four clades of anurans (Bufo, Hylinae, Leptodactylus and Rana) using semi-automatic, high-throughput analysis software. We employed two measures of call frequency: fundamental frequency (F0) and dominant frequency (DF). The slope of the relationship between male snout-vent length (SVL) and frequency did not differ significantly among the four clades. However, Rana call at a significantly lower frequency relative to size than the other clades, and Bufo call at a signifi- cantly higher frequency relative to size than Leptodactylus. Because the relation- ship between F0 and body size may be more straightforwardly explained by biomechanical constraints, we confirmed that a similar inverse relationship was observed between F0 and SVL. Finally, spectral flatness, an indicator of the tonality of the vocalizations, was found to be inversely correlated with SVL, contradicting an oft-cited prediction that larger animals should have rougher voices. Our results confirm a tight and widespread link between body size and call frequency in anurans, and suggest that laryngeal allometry and vocal fold dimen- sions in particular are responsible},

abstract = {Interspecifi c variation in parasite species richness among host species has generated much empirical research. As in compar- isons among geographical areas, controlling for variation in host body size is crucial because host size determines resource availability. Recent developments in the use of species – area relationships (SARs) to detect hotspots of biodiversity provide a powerful way to control for host body size, and to identify ‘ hot ' and ‘ cold hosts ' of parasite diversity, i.e. hosts with more or fewer parasites than expected from their size. Applying SAR modelling to six large datasets on parasite species richness in vertebrates, we search for hot and cold hosts and assess the eff ect of other ecological variables on the probability that a host species is hot/cold taking body size (and sampling eff ort) into account. Five non-sigmoid SAR models were fi tted to the data by optimisation; their relative likelihood was evaluated using the Bayesian information criterion, before deriving an averaged SAR function. Overall, the fi t between the fi ve SAR models and the actual data was poor; there was substantial uncertainty surrounding the fi tted models, and the best model diff ered among the six datasets. T ese results show that host body size is not a strong or consistent determinant of parasite species richness across taxa. Hotspots were defi ned as host species lying above the upper limit of the 80{\%} confi dence interval of the averaged SAR, and coldspots as species lying below its lower limit. Our analyses revealed (1) no apparent eff ect of specifi c ecological factors (i.e. water temperature, mean depth range, latitude or population density) on the likelihood of a host species being a hot or coldspot; (2) evidence of phylogenetic clustering, i.e. hosts from certain families are more likely to be hotspots (or coldspots) than other species, independently of body size. T ese fi ndings suggest that host phylogeny may sometimes outweigh specifi c host ecological traits as a predictor of whether or not a host species harbours more (or fewer) parasite species than expected for its size.},

Because organisms have different shapes, only a uniform proxy of size, such as mass, may be suitable for comparisons between taxa. Unfortunately, snake masses are rarely reported in the literature. On the basis of 423 species of snakes in 10 families, we developed clade-specific equations for the estimation of snake masses from snout–vent lengths and total lengths. We found that snout–vent lengths predict masses better than total lengths. By examining the effects of phylogeny, as well as ecological and life history traits on the relationship between mass and length, we found that viviparous species are heavier than oviparous species, and diurnal species are heavier than nocturnal species. Furthermore, microhabitat preferences profoundly influence body shape: arboreal snakes are lighter than terrestrial snakes, whereas aquatic snakes are heavier than terrestrial snakes of a similar length},

abstract = {Aim: To describe the geographical pattern of mean body size of the non-volant mammals of the Nearctic and Neotropics and evaluate the influence of five environmental variables that are likely to affect body size gradients. $\backslash$nLocation: The Western Hemisphere.$\backslash$nMethods: We calculated mean body size (average log mass) values in 110 × 110 km cells covering the continental Nearctic and Neotropics. We also generated cell averages for mean annual temperature, range in elevation, their interaction, actual evapotranspiration, and the global vegetation index and its coefficient of variation. Associations between mean body size and environmental variables were tested with simple correlations and ordinary least squares multiple regression, complemented with spatial autocorrelation analyses and split-line regression. We evaluated the relative support for each multiple-regression model using AIC. $\backslash$nResults: Mean body size increases to the north in the Nearctic and is negatively correlated with temperature. In contrast, across the Neotropics mammals are largest in the tropical and subtropical lowlands and smaller in the Andes, generating a positive correlation with temperature. Finally, body size and temperature are nonlinearly related in both regions, and split-line linear regression found temperature thresholds marking clear shifts in these relationships (Nearctic 10.9 °C; Neotropics 12.6 °C). The increase in body sizes with decreasing temperature is strongest in the northern Nearctic, whereas a decrease in body size in mountains dominates the body size gradients in the warmer parts of both regions. $\backslash$nMain conclusions: We confirm previous work finding strong broad-scale Bergmann trends in cold macroclimates but not in warmer areas. For the latter regions (i.e. the southern Nearctic and the Neotropics), our analyses also suggest that both local and broad-scale patterns of mammal body size variation are influenced in part by the strong mesoscale climatic gradients existing in mountainous areas. A likely explanation is that reduced habitat sizes in mountains limit the presence of larger-sized mammals.},

abstract = {The relative importance of biotic, abiotic, and stochastic processes in structuring ecological communities continues to be a central focus in community ecology. In order to assess the role of phylogenetic relatedness on the nature of biodiversity we first quantified the degree of phylogenetic niche conservatism of several plant traits linked to plant form and function. Next we quantified the degree of phylogenetic relatedness across two fundamental scaling dimensions: plant size and neighborhood size. The results show that phylogenetic niche conservatism is likely widespread, indicating that closely related species are more functionally similar than distantly related species. Utilizing this information we show that three of five tropical forest dynamics plots (FDPs) exhibit similar scale-dependent patterns of phylogenetic structuring using only a spatial scaling axis. When spatial- and size-scaling axes were analyzed in concert, phylogenetic overdispersion of co-occurring species was most important at small spatial scales and in four of five FDPs for the largest size class. These results suggest that phylogenetic relatedness is increasingly important: (1) at small spatial scales, where phylogenetic overdispersion is more common, and (2) in large size classes, where phylogenetic overdispersion becomes more common throughout ontogeny. Collectively, our results highlight the critical spatial and size scales at which the degree of phylogenetic relatedness between constituent species influences the structuring of tropical forest diversity.},

Zool. 28:299- 307.--Coevolution is defined as a combination of two processes: co-accommodation between host and parasite with no implication of host or parasite speciation and co-speciation, indicating concomitant host and parasite speciation. Parasite speciation in general is viewed as primarily the result of allopatric speciation processes regardless of host speciation or changes in host type. The observation that co-speciation of hosts and parasites forms a predominant pattern relates to a more general principle of biotic allopatric speciation explicit in the vicariance biogeography model, more than to an assumption that host speciation somehow causes parasite speciation. The close ecological relationship between hosts and parasites, which may be depicted using a variation of the MacArthur-Wilson island biogeography model, explains their spatial proximity at any time during which an isolating event occurs and thus may be necessary in some cases, but is not sufficient to explain parasite speciation, coevolution, or parasite phylogeny.},

This book presents a new technique for obtaining a partial answer to this elementary question about niche space. The author bases his technique on a relation between the combinatorial structure of food webs and the mathematical theory of interval graphs.Professor Cohen collects more than thirty food webs from the ecological literature and analyzes their statistical and combinatorial properties in detail. As a result, he is able to generalize: within habitats of a certain limited physical and temporal heterogeneity, the overlaps among niches, along their trophic (feeding) dimensions, can be represented in a one-dimensional niche space far more often than would be expected by chance alone and perhaps always. This compatibility has not previously been noticed. It indicates that real food webs fall in a small subset of the mathematically possible food webs.Professor Cohen discusses other apparently new features of real food webs, including the constant ratio of the number of kinds of prey to the number of kinds of predators in food webs that describe a community. In conclusion he discusses possible extensions and limitations of his results and suggests directions for future research.},

This chapter reviews the history of the search for generalities in the struc- ture of complex food webs, and discusses current and future research trends. Analysis of food-web structure has used empirical and model- ing approaches, and has been inspired both by questions from ecology such as “What factors promote stability of complex ecosystems given internal dynamics and external perturbations?”and questions from net- work research such as “Do food webs display universal structure similar to other types of networks?”Recent research has suggested that once variable diversity and connectance are taken into account, there are uni- versal coarse-grained characteristics of how trophic links and species defined according to trophic function are distributed within food webs.

abstract = {Sequence comparison and alignment has had an enormous impact on our understanding of evolution, biology and disease. Comparison and alignment of biological networks will probably have a similar impact. Existing network alignments use information external to the networks, such as sequence, because no good algorithm for purely topological alignment has yet been devised. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm based solely on network topology, that can be used to align any two networks. We apply it to biological networks to produce by far the most complete topological alignments of biological networks to date. We demonstrate that both species phylogeny and detailed biological function of individual proteins can be extracted from our alignments. Topology-based alignments have the potential to provide a completely new, independent source of phylogenetic information. Our alignment of the protein-protein interaction networks of two very different species-yeast and human-indicate that even distant species share a surprising amount of network topology, suggesting broad similarities in internal cellular wiring across all life on Earth.},

abstract = {Ecophylogenetics can be viewed as an emerging fusion of ecology, biogeography and macroevolution. This new and fast-growing field is promoting the incorporation of evolution and historical contingencies into the ecological research agenda through the widespread use of phylogenetic data. Including phylogeny into ecological thinking represents an opportunity for biologists from different fields to collaborate and has provided promising avenues of research in both theoretical and empirical ecology, towards a better understanding of the assembly of communities, the functioning of ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes. The time is ripe to assess critically the extent to which the integration of phylogeny into these different fields of ecology has delivered on its promise. Here we review how phylogenetic information has been used to identify better the key components of species interactions with their biotic and abiotic environments, to determine the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning and ultimately to establish good management practices to protect overall biodiversity in the face of global change. We evaluate the relevance of information provided by phylogenies to ecologists, highlighting current potential weaknesses and needs for future developments. We suggest that despite the strong progress that has been made, a consistent unified framework is still missing to link local ecological dynamics to macroevolution. This is a necessary step in order to interpret observed phylogenetic patterns in a wider ecological context. Beyond the fundamental question of how evolutionary history contributes to shape communities, ecophylogenetics will help ecology to become a better integrative and predictive science.},

We also test whether populations from depauperate lizard assemblages differ in dietary resource use with respect to variation within and/or among individuals and sexual dimorphism. We found support for the niche expansion and niche variation hypotheses. Populations in assemblages with low phylogenetic diversity had a higher degree of individual variation, suggesting a tendency for niche expansion.

abstract = {Previous studies suggest that food-web theory has yet to account for major differencesin food-web properties of marine versus other types of ecosystems. We examined this issue by analyzingthe network structure of food webs for the Northeast US Shelf, a Caribbean reef, andBenguela, off South Africa. The values of connectance (links per species2), link density (links per species),mean chain length, and fractions of intermediate, omnivorous, and cannibalistic taxa of thesemarine webs are somewhat high but still within the ranges observed in other webs. We further comparedthe marine webs by using the empirically corroborated `niche model' that accounts forobserved variation in diversity (taxon number) and complexity (connectance). Our results substantiatepreviously reported results for estuarine, fresh-water, and terrestrial datasets, which suggeststhat food webs from different types of ecosystems with variable diversity and complexity share fundamentalstructural and ordering characteristics. Analyses of potential secondary extinctions resultingfrom species loss show that the structural robustness of marine food webs is also consistent withtrends from other food webs. As expected, given their relatively high connectance, marine food websappear fairly robust to loss of most-connected taxa as well as random taxa. Still, the short averagepath length between marine taxa (1.6 links) suggests that effects from perturbations, such as overfishing,can be transmitted more widely throughout marine ecosystems than previously appreciated.},

abstract = {Most invasion histories include an estimated arrival time, followed by range expansion. Yet, such linear progression may not tell the entire story. The European green crab (Carcinus maenas) was first recorded in the US in 1817, followed by an episodic expansion of range to the north. Its population has recently exploded in the Canadian Maritimes. Although it has been suggested that this northern expansion is the result of warming sea temperatures or cold-water adaptation, Canadian populations have higher genetic diversity than southern populations, indicating that multiple introductions have occurred in the Maritimes since the 1980s. These new genetic lineages, probably from the northern end of the green crab's native range in Europe, persist in areas that were once thought to be too cold for the original southern invasion front. It is well established that ballast water can contain a wide array of nonindigenous species. Ballast discharge can also deliver genetic variation on a level comparable to that of native populations. Such gene flow not only increases the likelihood of persistence of invasive species, but it can also rapidly expand the range of long-established nonindigenous species.},

To evaluate the genetic variation in this population, we examined 10 microsatellite loci and a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus. The genetic variation was significantly less than found in other populations of the same subspecies in Arizona. Using a model that takes into account the effects of genetic drift on genetic distance, most of the genetic distance observed between the Tiburon population and Arizona samples could be explained. Because of the low genetic variation found in the Tiburon population, it is suggested that the Tiburon population should be supplemented with additional unrelated animals or that the transplant populations should be supplemented with unrelated animals.},

The results are that in some cases it is possible for one species to exclude another species from a geographic region, but there is no possibility of a @'priority effect@' where the first species in the region can always exclude the other. Thus the equilibrium level of each species is determined by the parameters of the system and not by the initial conditions. Also, it is possible for two similar species to coexist in a region.

The molecular basis of coccolith production is still relatively unknown although its importance in global biogeochemical cycles and varying sensitivity to increased pCO2 levels has been well documented. This study looks into the role of several candidate Ca2+, H+ and inorganic carbon transport genes in E. huxleyi, using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Differential gene expression analysis was investigated in two isogenic pairs of calcifying and non-calcifying strains of E. huxleyi and cultures grown at various Ca2+ concentrations to alter calcite production. We show that calcification correlated to the consistent upregulation of a putative HCO3- transporter belonging to the solute carrier 4 (SLC4) family, a Ca2+/H+ exchanger belonging to the CAX family of exchangers and a vacuolar H+-ATPase. We also show that the coccolith-associated protein, GPA is downregulated in calcifying cells. The data provide strong evidence that these genes play key roles in E. huxleyi biomineralization. Based on the gene expression data and the current literature a working model for biomineralization-related ion transport in coccolithophores is presented.},

We present quantitative estimates of beta-diversity for tropical trees by comparing species composition of plots in lowland terra firme forest in Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. We compare observations with predictions derived from a neutral model in which habitat is uniform and only dispersal and speciation influence species turnover. We find that beta-diversity is higher in Panama than in western Amazonia and that patterns in both areas are inconsistent with the neutral model. In Panama, habitat variation appears to increase species turnover relative to Amazonia, where unexpectedly low turnover over great distances suggests that population densities of some species are bounded by as yet unidentified processes. At intermediate scales in both regions, observations can be matched by theory, suggesting that dispersal limitation, with speciation, influences species turnover},

abstract = {The dictionary definition of a law is: "Generalized formulation based on a series of events or processes observed to recur regularly under certain conditions; a widely observable tendency". I argue that ecology has numerous laws in this sense of the word, in the form of widespread, repeatable patterns in nature, but hardly any laws that are universally true. Typically, in other words, ecological patterns and the laws, rules and mechanisms that underpin them are contingent on the organisms involved, and their environment. This contingency is manageable at a relatively simple level of ecological organisation (for example the population dynamics of single and small numbers of species), and re-emerges also in a manageable form in large sets of species, over large spatial scales, or over long time periods, in the form of detail-free statistical patterns - recently called 'macroecology'. The contingency becomes over- whelmingly complicated at intermediate scales, characteristic of community ecology, where there are a large number of case histories, and very little other than weak, fuzzy generalizations. These arguments are illustrated by focusing on examples of typical studies in community ecology, and by way of contrast, on the macroecological relationship that emerges between local species richness and the size of the regional pool of species. The emergent pattern illustrated by local vs regional richness plots is extremely simple, despite the vast number of contingent processes and interactions involved in its generation.

The real question, however, is how did these niche differences evolve, how are they maintained ecologically, and what niche differences, if any, matter to the assembly of ecological communities? By ecological community I refer to co-occurring assem- blages of trophically similar species. By assembly I mean which species, having which niche traits, and how many species, co-occur in a given community. In my judgement, despite a long and rich tradition of research on these questions in community ecology (Chase {\{}{\&}{\}} Leibold 2003), we are still far from having answers.},

abstract = {Arboreal frugivores, such as primates and hornbills, are important seed dispersers for many tropical plant species, yet the degree to which they use the same resources is unknown. If primates and hornbills consume the same fruit species, they may be redundant in their roles as seed dispersers, and the loss of one of these taxa may be compensated for by the other. To examine resource use by tropical frugivores, we quantified the feeding habits of two hornbill species, Ceratogymna atrata and C. cylindricus, and five primate species, Colobus guereza, Lophocebus albigena, Cercopithecus pogonias, C. cephus, and C. nictitans, in the lowland rainforest of south-central Cameroon. Based on over 2200 feeding observations recorded between January and December 1998, we characterized the diets and estimated dietary overlap among frugivore species. Previous studies have calculated dietary overlap by counting the number of diet species that two animals share, often leading to inflated estimates of overlap. Our method incorporated the proportional use of diet species and fruit availability into randomization procedures, allowing a clearer assessment of the actual degree of overlap. This added complexity of analysis revealed that, although the diets of a hornbill and a primate species may have as many as 36 plant species in common, actual dietary overlap is low. These results suggested that there are distinct hornbill and primate feeding assemblages, with primates consuming a greater diversity of plant species and higDifferential resources use by primatesher levels of nonfruit items like leaves and seeds. Using Correspondence Analysis, we also identified two primate assemblages, separated largely by degree of frugivory and folivory. In addition, we found that hornbills feed at significantly higher strata in the forest canopy and eat fruits of different colors than primates. Averaged across the year, overlap between groups (hornbill–primate) was significantly lower than combined within-group overlap (primate–primate and hornbill–hornbill), showing that primates and hornbills have dissimilar diets and are not redundant as seed dispersers. In equatorial Africa, primate populations face greater declines than hornbill populations because of hunting. It is unlikely that seed dispersal by hornbills will compensate for the loss of primates in maintaining},

abstract = {Recent work has shown that antagonist (e.g. predator-prey food web) and mutualist (e.g. pollinator-plant) network structure can be altered by global environmental change drivers, and that these alterations may have important ecosystem-level consequences. This has prompted calls for the conservation of network structure, but precisely which attributes of webs should be conserved remains unclear. Further, the extent to which network metrics characterise the spatiotemporally-variable dynamic structure of interacting communities is unknown. Here, we summarise the attributes of web structure that are predicted to confer stability or increased function to a system, as these may be of greatest interest to conservation biologists. However, empirical evaluation of these effects is lacking in most cases, and we discuss whether stability is even desirable in all contexts. The incorporation of web attributes into conservation monitoring requires that changes in these attributes can be recorded (sampled) with relative ease. We contrast the sensitivity of metrics to sampling effort, and highlight those (such as nestedness and connectance) that could easily be incorporated into conservation monitoring. Despite our growing understanding of the characteristics of food webs that confer stability and function, numerous practical challenges need to be overcome before the goal of conserving species interaction networks can be achieved. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The main drivers of global environmental change (CO 2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.},

abstract = {Since nobody has witnessed the arrival of early plant colonists on isolated islands, the actual long-distance dispersal (hereafter LDD) has historically been a matter of speculation. In the present study, we offer a new approach that evaluates whether particular syndromes for LDD (i.e. the set of traits related to diaspore dispersal by animals, wind and sea currents) have been favourable in the natural colonization of the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands by plants. Dispersal syndromes of the 251 native genera (509 angiosperm species) presently acknowledged as native were carefully studied, combining data from floristic lists of the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands, diaspore traits, characteristics of continental relatives and our own observations. We used these genera (and occasionally infrageneric groups) as the working units to infer the number of introductions and colonists. A final number of native plants was inferred and analysed after correcting by pollen records of six species from six genera previously considered exotic (palaeobotanical correction). The number of early colonists was also corrected by incorporating information from the few (n= 12) phylogenetic studies of genera from both the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands and the Americas (phylogenetic correction). A total of 372 colonization events were inferred for the native flora using the latest check-list. The proportions of native colonists grouped into five categories were: endozoochory 16.4{\%}, epizoochory 15.7{\%}, hydrochory 18.6{\%}, anemochory 13.3{\%}, and unassisted diaspores 36.0{\%}. These figures did not vary significantly on analysing only the 99 genera that include endemic species in order to rule out any human-mediated introductions. Irrespective of the roles of the different agents involved in LDD, diaspores with no special syndrome for LDD (unassisted diapores), such as many dry fruits, have been successful in reaching and colonizing the Gal{\'{a}}pagos archipelago. This finding leads us to suggest that unpredictable and so far unknown LDD mechanisms should be further considered in the theory of island biogeography.},

abstract = {Seagrass plants with associated macrofauna were confined within transparent Perspex tubes in the field at two Western Australian sites, Cliff Head and Seven Mile Beach, and faunal population changes in the microcosms monitored and compared with changes in the field. Three microcosm treatments were set up at Cliff Head: (i) "dark" microcosms, in which primary production was reduced by wrapping the tubes in black plastic, (ii) "faunal reduction" microcosms, in which the food resources available to each animal were enhanced by removing 80{\%} of the fauna, and (iii) "control" microcosms. Faunal abundances in control microcosms remained relatively constant, while the population numbers of nearly half of the common epifaunal species placed in dark microcosms declined relative to numbers in the control treatments. The abundances of almost all species in the faunal reduction microcosms rapidly increased, with proportionately more crustaceans carrying eggs in faunal reduction microcosms than in the other treatments. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that epifaunal populations are food limited. Other studies have shown that the diets of different epifaunal species are broadly overlapping, hence diffuse exploitative competition is probably a major structuring agent amongst the seagrass epifauna. The populations of almost all epifaunal species fluctuated greatly with season in the field. These annual population cycles did not, however, generally correspond closely between the Cliff Head and Seven Mile Beach sites. Therefore, no single factor, including those implicated to be important in other studies (such as temperature, photoperiod, seagrass biomass and epiphytic biomass), had a controlling influence on the population dynamics of the majority of epifaunal species. The annual population cycles of almost all species at Cliff Head nevertheless coincided with highest faunal densities occurring in late summer or early autumn, followed by a rapid decline to very low densities in winter. Animal populations inside microcosms did not change greatly at the time of rapid declines in field populations. A large-scale autumn emigration of mobile crustaceans from the Cliff Head site in response to low levels of microalgal food and/or dissolved oxygen is postulated to have occurred. ?? 1990.},

The model suggests that most lineages have tropical origins, with few dispersing into temperate regions. However, biotas are comprised of lineages with differing geographical origins, thus it is unclear whether lineages that originated on different continents will exhibit similar patterns of niche conservatism. Here, we summarised biogeographical patterns of New World vertebrates and compared species diversity patterns between families that originated in North and South America. Overall, families with southern origins exhibit niche conservatism with many lineages restricted to the Neotropics, whereas many northern-origin families are distributed across the Neotropics and the Nearctic. Consequently, northern lineages have contributed to high tropical biodiversity, but southern lineages have contributed relatively little to temperate biodiversity in North America. The asymmetry in niche conservatism between northern and southern lineages is an important contributor to the biodiversity gradient},

abstract = {To evaluate the roles of extinction and isolation in predicting richness and composition of fish assemblages in small forest lakes of Finland and Wisconsin, we analyzed data from 114 Finnish and 55 Wisconsin lakes 0.2-86.9 ha in area. Six isolation variables characterized properties of stream corridors, land barriers, and source pools of invading species; four extinction variables were related to habitat severity, lake area, and productivity. Two types of multivariate analyses were used: the nonparametric classification and regression trees (CART) and the parametric linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Both types of analyses showed that extinction variables were collectively more important than isolation variables in predicting richness and composition both in Finland and Wisconsin. We interpret that the greater importance of extinction vs. isolation results, not because isolation is unimportant, but because the probability of an arrival of a new species is much less than that of an extinction. Thus, the time after an extinction event before a subsequent invasion is long relative to the time after an invasion event before a subsequent extinction; consequently, fish assemblages sampled at a given point in time more likely represent the stamp of the extinctions than of the invasions. This conclusion was robust to the differences in the geomorphic settings and fish faunas of Finland and Wisconsin. However, the importance of individual isolation and extinction variables in determining richness and composition differed between the two regions, apparently more from differences in geomorphic settings than from differences in fish faunas. Influences of horizontal rather than vertical barriers over land and water were more apparent in Wisconsin, with its lower relief and higher incidence of lakes without stream connections; influences of the area of the nearest lake (representing the size of the available species pool) and stream gradient were more important in Finland, with its higher relief and higher incidence of lakes with stream connections. The importance of individual extinction variables also differed between the two regions, again reflecting differences in the geomorphic settings of the two lake districts and the strong influence that lake position in the landscape has in determining limnological features of the lake.},

abstract = {Trophic cascades are extensively documented in nature, but they are also known to vary widely in strength and frequency across ecosystems. Therefore, much effort has gone into understanding which ecological factors generate variation in cascade strength. To identify which factors covary with the strength of cascades in streams, we performed a concurrent experiment across 17 streams throughout the Sierra Nevada Mountains. We eliminated top consumers from experimental substrates using electrical exclusions and compared the strength of indirect effects of consumers on the biomass of primary producers relative to control patches. In each stream we 1) classified the dominant invertebrate herbivores according to life-history traits that influence their susceptibility to predators, 2) determined the abundance and diversity of algae and herbivores, and 3) measured production-to-biomass ratios (P:B) of the stream biofilm. This allowed us to assess three common predictions about factors thought to influence the strength of trophic cascades: cascade strength 1) is weaker in systems dominated by herbivores with greater ability to evade or defend against predators, 2) is stronger in systems characterized by low species diversity, and 3) increases with increasing producer P:B. When averaged across all streams, the indirect effect of predators increased the biomass of periphyton by a mean 60{\%}. However, impacts of predators on algae varied widely, ranging from effects that exacerbated algal loss to herbivores, to strong cascades that increased algal biomass by 4.35 times. Cascade strength was not related to herbivore traits or species diversity, but decreased significantly with increasing algal diversity and biofilm P:B in a stream. Partial regression analyses suggested that the relationship between cascade strength and algal diversity was spurious, and that the only significant covariate after statistically controlling for cross-correlations was algal P: B. Our study contributes to the ongoing debate about why trophic cascade strength varies in nature and is useful because it eliminates factors that have no potential to explain variation in cascades within these stream ecosystems.},

By examining historical examples from biogeography, natural history, the science of energy, and biomedical sciences, we can appreciate the many different contexts in which ecological thinking has evolved, whether as part of larger projects to systematize and unify knowledge of the world, or in response to particular problems that were solved by taking a fresh approach. It is important, when educating students and the public, to convey this diversity of ecological thought and the nature of ecology as an integrative discipline.},

abstract = {Thirty years of study to demonstrate, quantify, and explain the latitudinal gradient of species richness in mammals of the New World have produced two results; a surety that such a gradient exists and a lack of consensus as to what causes the inverse relationship between species richness and latitude. If the effects of continental area are removed, the latitudinal gradient remains strong and proves to be universal for the New World. This gradient in richness occurs not only at the species level, but also at a series of macro taxonomic levels (generic, familial, and ordinal), which represents a distribution of ecological types, or bau- plans. What causes these phenomena? I assert that none of the specific explanations that have been proposed (e.g., competition or spatial heterogeneity) alone can account for the latitudinal pattern. A universal explanation is likely to be more general; I propose that there is a shift in the impact of abiotic and biotic factors that limit species along the gradient from the poles to the equator. This shift, in tum, produces a change in factors that influence species richness from one that limits the number of species in polar regions to one that limits the physical or niche space of species in the tropics. Ultimately, these phenomena produce the latitudinal gradient (as well as the Rapoport's rule phenomena). Effects of abiotic and biotic factors are different for species and bauplans; species are impacted heavi- ly by both, whereas bauplans are influenced much more strongly by abiotic factors.},

abstract = {Understanding the structure of food webs, and the mechanisms that give rise to this structure, is one of the most challenging problems in ecology. We analyze from a statistical physics perspective the network structure of model food webs and of 15 community food webs from a variety of environments, including freshwater, marine, estuarine, and terrestrial environments. We perform a theoretical analysis of two recently proposed models for food webs, the niche model of R. J. Williams and N. D. Martinez and the nested-hierarchy model of M.-F. Cattin et al. We find that the two models generate distributions of numbers of prey, predators, and links that are described by the same analytical expressions. Our analytical treatment reveals that a model's capacity to reproduce empirical data is principally determined by its ability to satisfy two conditions: (1) the species' niche values form a totally ordered set and (2) each species has a specific exponentially decaying probability of preying on a given fraction of the species with lower niche values. To test this hypothesis, we generalize the cascade model of J. E. Cohen and C. M. Newman so that it satisfies condition 2 and find that the new model is able to reproduce the properties of empirical food webs, validating our hypothesis. We use our analytical predictions as a guide to the analysis of 15 of the most complete empirical food webs available. We demonstrate that the quantitative unifying patterns that describe the properties of the food-web models considered earlier also describe the majority of the empirical webs considered. We find good agreement between the empirical data and the models for the average distance between species and the average clustering coefficient. Our results strongly support two hypotheses: first, that any model satisfying the two conditions we identify will accurately reproduce a number of the statistical properties of empirical food webs, and second, that the empirical distributions of number of prey and number of predators follow universal functional forms that, without free parameters, match our analytical predictions.},

All ecologists know he founded modernnomenclature and systematics (Larson 1971, Stafleu1971, Mayr 1982:171-180, Eriksson 1983), but he isless well known for inventing an ecological sciencehe called the economy of nature. He explained it in1749, but the overly broad science of natural history,which he had pursued since childhood, was alreadyecological in outlook and content. In 1749 he generalizedand formalized what he had been recordingspecifically and informally. A series of 186 essays,largely by Linnaeus, were defended by his studentsas dissertations for their doctoral degrees (Jackson1913, Ramsbottom 1959:151-153, Smit 1989:118-119, Kiger et al.1999:231), and one of these wasSpecimen academicum de oeconomia naturae (1749),defended by Isaac J. Biberg. Linnaeus republishedthese dissertations in 10 volumes entitled AmoenitatesAcademica (Academic Pleasures, 1749-1790),though the last two volumes appeared posthumously.The Amoenitates Academica has been reprinted severaltimes, and 19 dissertations are translated intoEnglish (Linnaeus 1775, 1781, 1977a, b). There is ahelpful Index to Scientific Names of Organisms citedin Linnaean Dissertations (Kiger et al. 1999), with aguide to collected editions. Linnaeus' earlier naturalhistory observations are recorded in travel books andother writings. All of his travel books and the dissertationsare listed in B. H. Soulsby's catalogue of Linnaeus'works (1933:23-26, 99-151). Florence Caddy(1886-1887) provides two good maps on Linnaeus'travels, though the caption to the one at the end ofvolume I is misdated 1735-1738 (read 1732-1738).},

We studied the avifauna of 235 small (0.1-39 ha) woodlots composed of mature deciduous trees in 1984- 1985. These woodlots were selected in the eastern and central/southern part of the country within 22 regions showing great differences in landscape structure, i.e., degree of isolation. Multiple regression analysis indicated that woodlot size was the best single predictor of species number and probability of occurrence of most species. It turned out that the isolation variables, area of wood, number of woods, interpatch distance, and proximity and density of connecting elements, explained small but significant parts of the residual variances in species number. No single species was significantly affected by the density of con- necting elements. Biogeographical differences between two groups of regions were emphasized. Evidence of four woodland- species suggested that regional abundance affected the probability of occurrence in small isolates.},

abstract = {Ecological stability is touted as a complex and multifaceted concept, including components such as variability, resistance, resilience, persistence and robustness. Even though a complete appreciation of the effects of perturbations on ecosystems requires the simultaneous measurement of these multiple components of stability, most ecological research has focused on one or a few of those components analysed in isolation. Here, we present a new view of ecological stability that recognises explicitly the non-independence of components of stability. This provides an approach for simplifying the concept of stability. We illustrate the concept and approach using results from a field experiment, and show that the effective dimensionality of ecological stability is considerably lower than if the various components of stability were unrelated. However, strong perturbations can modify, and even decouple, relationships among individual components of stability. Thus, perturbations not only increase the dimensionality of stability but they can also alter the relationships among components of stability in different ways. Studies that focus on single forms of stability in isolation therefore risk underestimating significantly the potential of perturbations to destabilise ecosystems. In contrast, application of the multidimensional stability framework that we propose gives a far richer understanding of how communities respond to perturbations.},

Our results show that these food web models are able to reproduce the structure of most of the mutualistic networks and even the simplest among the food web models, the cascade model, often reproduce overall structural properties of real mutualistic networks.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Based on our results we hypothesize that processes leading to feeding hierarchy, which is a characteristic shared by all food web models, might be a fundamental aspect in the assembly of mutualisms.

abstract = {Bats are the natural reservoirs of a number of high-impact viral zoonoses. We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.},

Most ENI bird species are established locally; a few are spreading or widespread. There has been a recent large increase in establishment. All ENI birds are of tropical origin, mostly from the Ethiopian and Oriental regions; the main families are Sturnidae, Psittacidae, Anatidae, and Columbidae. Most species have been deliberately brought to Israel in captivity and subsequently released or escaped. Most of these birds are commensal with humans to some degree, are not typically migratory, and have mean body mass larger than that of the entire order. ENI birds are not distributed randomly. There are centers in the Tel-Aviv area and along the Rift Valley, which is also a corridor of spread. Positive correlations were found between ENI bird richness and mean annual temperature and urbanization. Mediterranean forests and desert regions have fewer ENI species than expected.

abstract = {A robust food web is one in which few secondary extinctions occur after removing species. We investigated how parasites affected the robustness of the Carpinteria Salt Marsh food web by conducting random species removals and a hypothetical, but plausible, species invasion. Parasites were much more likely than free-living species to suffer secondary extinctions following the removal of a free-living species from the food web. For this reason, the food web was less robust with the inclusion of parasites. Removal of the horn snail, Cerithidea californica, resulted in a disproportionate number of secondary parasite extinctions. The exotic Japanese mud snail, Batillaria attramentaria, is the ecological analogue of the native California horn snail and can completely replace it following invasion. Owing to the similarities between the two snail species, the invasion had no effect on predator-prey interactions. However, because the native snail is host for 17 host-specific parasites, and the invader is host to only one, comparison of a food web that includes parasites showed significant effects of invasion on the native community. The hypothetical invasion also significantly reduced the connectance of the web because the loss of 17 native trematode species eliminated many links.},

abstract = {Several of the most ambitious theories in ecology describe food webs that document the structure of strong and weak trophic links that is responsible for ecological dynamics among diverse assemblages of species. Early mechanism-based theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and several properties that are independent of species richness. This theory was overturned by empirical studies that found food webs to be much more complex, but these studies did not provide mechanistic$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexplanations for the complexity. Here we show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void by successfully$\backslash$r$\backslash$npredicting key structural properties of the most complex and comprehensive food webs in the primary literature. These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species number and connectance, our `niche model' extends the existing `cascade model' and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche.},

abstract = {Estimates of the total number of species that inhabit the Earth have increased significantly since Linnaeus's initial catalog of 20,000 species. The best recent estimates suggest that there are approximately 6 million species. More emphasis has been placed on counts of free-living species than on parasitic species. We rectify this by quantifying the numbers and proportion of parasitic species. We estimate that there are between 75,000 and 300,000 helminth species parasitizing the vertebrates. We have no credible way of estimating how many parasitic protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and viruses exist. We estimate that between 3{\%} and 5{\%} of parasitic helminths are threatened with extinction in the next 50 to 100 years. Because patterns of parasite diversity do not clearly map onto patterns of host diversity, we can make very little prediction about geographical patterns of threat to parasites. If the threats reflect those experienced by avian hosts, then we expect climate change to be a major threat to the relatively small proportion of parasite diversity that lives in the polar and temperate regions, whereas habitat destruction will be the major threat to tropical parasite diversity. Recent studies of food webs suggest that approximately 75{\%} of the links in food webs involve a parasitic species; these links are vital for regulation of host abundance and potentially for reducing the impact of toxic pollutants. This implies that parasite extinctions may have unforeseen costs that impact the health and abundance of a large number of free-living species.},

abstract = {While trophic levels have found broad application throughout ecology, they are also in much contention on analytical and empirical grounds. Here, we use a new generation of data and theory to examine long-standing questions about trophic-level limits and degrees of omnivory. The data include food webs of the Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A., the island of Saint Martin, a U.K. grassland, and a Florida seagrass community, which appear to be the most trophically complete food webs available in the primary literature due to their inclusion of autotrophs and empirically derived estimates of the relative energetic contributions of each trophic link. We show that most (54{\%}) of the 212 species in the four food webs can be unambiguously assigned to a discrete trophic level. Omnivory among the remaining species appears to be quite limited, as judged by the standard deviation of omnivores' energy-weighted food-chain lengths. This allows simple algorithms based on binary food webs without energetic details to yield surprisingly accurate estimates of species' trophic and omnivory levels. While maximum trophic levels may plausibly exceed historically asserted limits, our analyses contradict both recent empirical claims that these limits are exceeded and recent theoretical claims that rampant omnivory eliminates the scientific utility of the trophic-level concept.},

abstract = {How do species divide resources to produce the characteristic species abundance distributions seen in nature? One way to resolve this problem is to examine how the biomass (or capacity) of the spatial guilds that combine to produce an abundance distribution is allocated among species. Here we argue that selection on body size varies across guilds occupying spatially distinct habitats. Using an exceptionally well-characterized estuarine fish community, we show that biomass is concentrated in large bodied species in guilds where habitat structure provides protection from predators, but not in those guilds associated with open habitats and where safety in numbers is a mechanism for reducing predation risk. We further demonstrate that while there is temporal turnover in the abundances and identities of species that comprise these guilds, guild rank order is conserved across our 30-year time series. These results demonstrate that ecological communities are not randomly assembled but can be decomposed into guilds where capacity is predictably allocated among species.},

The biomass of trematodes was particularly high, being comparable to that of the abundant birds, fishes, burrowing shrimps and polychaetes. Trophically transmitted parasites and parasitic castrators subsumed more biomass than did other parasitic functional groups. The extended phenotype biomass controlled by parasitic castrators sometimes exceeded that of their uninfected hosts. The annual production of free-swimming trematode transmission stages was greater than the combined biomass of all quantified parasites and was also greater than bird biomass.

abstract = {Explaining the coexistence of closely related species sharing a single resource has been a long-standing challenge in ecology. Here we report on studies comparing the aphids Aphis nerii and A. asclepiadis that feed sympatrically on the milkweed Asclepias syriaca in northeastern North America. We sought to identify tradeoffs among species' attributes that might promote coexistence, but in most instances A. nerii was superior to A. asclepiadis. Aphis nerii was 84{\%} more fecund, fed upon 880{\%} more phloem sap, and was affected 70{\%} less by intraspecific competition as compared to A. asclepiadis. In interspecific competition, A. nerii reduced A. asclepiadis abundance by 77{\%}, whereas A. asclepiadis did not affect A. nerii. In dispersal trials, 10{\%} of winged A. nerii but only 1{\%} of A. asclepiadis successfully moved from non-host plants to A. syriaca. We also investigated whether there were differences in aphid interactions with milkweed cardenolides. Jasmonic acid increased milkweed cardenolides by 33{\%}, a realistic amount similar to that induced by several leaf-chewing herbivores. Nevertheless, jasmonate-induced cardenolides failed to affect aphid performance and aphid feeding had no effect on milkweed cardenolide concentration. Yet cardenolides were important for aphid resistance to predators; A. nerii sequestered 25{\%} more cardenolides and was preyed upon 50{\%} less than A. asclepiadis. Interactions with cardenolides thus again favored A. nerii over A. asclepiadis. Given that A. nerii and A. asclepiadis are decidedly not equivalent in their demography, competitive ability, defense and dispersal, our results strongly refute the notion that neutral processes can explain coexistence of these aphids. Based on field observations, we propose two tradeoffs - timing of milkweed colonization and relationships with ants - as putative mechanisms for the coexistence of these congeners.},

abstract = {1. Despite their documented effects on trophic interactions and community structure, parasites are rarely included in food web analyses. The transmission routes of most parasitic helminths follow closely the trophic relationships among their successive hosts and are thus embedded in food webs, in a way that may influence energy flow and the structure of the web. 2. We investigated the impact of parasitism on the food web structure of a New Zealand intertidal mudflat community. Different versions of the food web were analysed, one with no parasites, one with all parasite species and several other versions, each including a single parasite species. We measured key food web metrics such as food chain length, linkage density and proportions of top, intermediate and basal species. 3. The inclusion of all parasite species in the food web resulted in greatly increased mean and maximum food chain length, but had little impact on linkage density and realized connectance. The main change caused by introduction of parasites was the relegation of a number of species from top predators to intermediate status, although the addition of parasites as top predators left the actual ratio of predators to prey relatively unchanged. 4. When individual parasites were added to the food web, their effect on food web properties was generally minimal. However, one trematode species that affected several host species, because of its complex life cycle and low host specificity, produced food web properties similar to those in the web version including all parasite species. 5. The respective effect of individual parasite species was roughly proportional to the number of host species they affected, and thus the life cycle characteristics of parasites determine to a large extent their impact on food web structure. The next step would be to quantify how they affect energy flow through the web.},

The complete geographical ranges of British birds have been censused twice, in the periods 1968-72 and 1988-91, allowing rates of colonization and extinction between these periods to be estimated. 3. The local colonization dynamics of species are influenced independently by their range sizes and the dispersal abilities of adult birds: species with smaller range sizes and larger dispersal distances were more likely to have colonized new areas between the two census periods. 4. The local extinction dynamics of species are influenced independently by their population sizes and body masses: species with smaller population sizes and body sizes were more likely to have gone extinct from areas inhabited in the first census period. 5. These results remain when controlling for the effects of phylogenetic relatedness. 6.

These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks.

The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n3. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n4. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n5. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n6. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

abstract = {Ecological neutral theory has elicited strong opinions in recent years. Here, we review these opinions and strip away some unfortunate problems with semantics to reveal three major underlying questions. Only one of these relates to neutral theory and the importance of ecological drift, whereas the others involve the link between pattern and process, the tradeoff between simplicity and complexity in modeling, and the role of stochasticity and drift in ecology. We explain how neutral theory cannot be simultaneously used both as a null hypothesis and as an approximation. However, we also show how neutral theory always has a valuable use in one of these two roles, even though the real world is not neutral. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding what structures ecological communities is vital to answering questions about extinctions, environmental change, trophic cascades, and ecosystem functioning. Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65{\%} of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model's successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction. The model results support the hypothesis that individual behavior, subject to natural selection, determines individual diets and that food web structure is the sum of these individual decisions.},

abstract = {1. Food webs, the set of predator–prey interactions in an ecosystem, are a prototypical complex system. Much research to date has concentrated on the use of models to identify and explain the key structural features which characterize food webs. 2. These models often fall into two general categories: (i) phenomenological models which are built upon a set of heuristic rules in order to explain some empirical observation and (ii) population- level models in which interactions between individuals result in emergent properties for the food web. Both types of models have helped to uncover how food-web structure is a product of factors such as foraging behaviour, prey selection and species' body sizes. 3. Historically, the two types of models have followed rather different approaches to the problem. Despite the apparent differences, the overlap between the two styles of models is substantial. Examples are highlighted here. 4. By paying greater attention to both the similarities and differences between the two, we will be better able to demonstrate the ecological insights offered by phenomenological models. This will help us, for example, design experiments which could validate or refute underlying assumptions of the models. By linking models to data, scaling from individuals to networks, we will be closer to understanding the true origins of food-web structure.},

In the statistical computing environment R, there are a few packages that estimate models of this kind. The package lme4 is a de facto standard for mixed effects models. The package glmmML allows non-normal distributions in the specification of random intercepts. It also allows for the estimation of a fixed effects model, assuming that all cluster intercepts are distinct fixed parameters; moreover, a bootstrapping technique is implemented to replace asymptotic analysis. The random intercepts model is fitted using a maximum likelihood estimator with adaptive GaussHermite and Laplace quadrature approximations of the likelihood function. The fixed effects model is fitted through a profiling approach, which is necessary when the number of clusters is large. In a simulation study, the two approaches are compared. The fixed effects model has severe bias when the mixed effects variance is positive and the number of clusters is large. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We sampled 505 specimens of 7 arachnid orders (313 Araneae, 65 Opiliones, 111 Pseudoscorpiones, 10 Ricinulei, 3 Schizomida, 1 Thelyphonida, 2 Scorpiones) in natural forest and agroforestry sites in central Amazonia to analyze fresh and dry mass to body length relations. The low number of schizomids, scorpions, and thelyphonids did not allow statistical analyses, but the raw data are given, because these represent the first data published for these groups from Amazonia. For all other orders general mass-length relationships for ecological studies were determined. Non-linear regressions with a power model proved to describe the relations very well and are highly significant for all taxa and groups analyzed. The resulting equations can thus be used to estimate biomass of large samples of arachnids from Amazonia based on individual body length measurements. Linear regressions of mass to length with log-transformed data also described the relation adequately, but using the resulting equations to estimate biomass of the whole spider sample caused a higher bias. This is because small biases of mass-length relation of the largest spider individuals are exponentiated. However, linear regressions behaved better for spiders smaller than 8 mm. The ratio of dry to fresh mass was around 0.3 for spiders; 0.4 for pseudoscorpions, schizomids, and thelyphonids; 0.44 for opilionids; and 0.53 for Ricinulei. A second sample of 99 spiders from a South Brazilian Atlantic Forest revealed similar mass-length relations, but a different dry to fresh mass ratio. For spiders, the usefulness of general equations to determine the biomass of bulk samples from ecological studies with certain precision requirements was further explored by using the equations from the two datasets crosswise, regarding the resulting bias and by applying equations to a further dataset from an ecological investigation. In conclusion and accordance to former studies, general equations derived from mass-length regressions of bulk samples including many specimens of different families and guilds are appropriate for an estimation of the biomass of bulk samples from ecological studies. Equations from mass-length regressions from the literature, resulting from spider samples in temperate regions, should not be used to estimate biomass of samples from neotropical spider assemblages, especially when absolute biomass is of interest and when precision is required. They underestimate biomass of tropical assemblages due to a strong bias in mass-length relation of tropical spiders larger than 10 mm. Depending on the distribution of large spiders in samples, considerable biases in single samples could affect ecological analyses.},

abstract = {1. In community and population ecology, there is a chronic gap between the classic Eltonian ecology describing patterns in abundance and body mass across species and ecosystems and the more process oriented foraging ecology addressing interactions and quantitative population dynamics. However, this dichotomy is arbitrary, because body mass also determines most species traits affecting foraging interactions and population dynamics. 2. In this review, allometric (body-mass dependent) scaling of handling times and attack rates are documented, whereas body-mass effects on Hill exponents (varying between hyperbolic type II and sigmoid type III functional responses) and predator interference coefficients are lacking. This review describes how these allometric relationships define a biological plausible parameter space for population dynamic models. 3. Consistent with the classic Eltonian description, species co-existence in consumer-resource models and tri-trophic food chains is restricted to intermediate consumer-resource body-mass ratios. Allometric population dynamic models allow understanding the processes of energy limitation and unstable dynamics leading to this restriction. Complex food webs are stabilized by high predator-prey body-mass ratios, which are consistent with those found in natural ecosystems. These high body-mass ratios yield positive diversity-stability and complexity-stability relationships thus supporting the classic picture of ecosystem stability. 4. Allometric-trophic network models, based on body mass and trophic information from ecosystems, bridge the gap between Eltonian community patterns and process-oriented foraging ecology and provide a new means to describe the dynamics and functioning of natural ecosystems.},

The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult.

abstract = {Biogeographers study all patterns in the geographic variation of life, from the spatial variation in genetic and physiological characteristics of cells and individuals, to the diversity and dynamics of biological communities among continental biotas or across oceanic archipelagoes. The field of island biogeography, in particular, has provided some genuinely transformative insights for the biological sciences, especially ecology and evolutionary biology. Our purpose here is to review the historical development of island biogeography theory during the 20th century by identifying the common threads that run through four sets of contributions made during this period, including those by Eugene Gordon Munroe (1948, 1953), Edward O. Wilson (1959, 1961), Frank W. Preston (1962a,b), and the seminal collaborations between Wilson and Robert H. MacArthur (1963, 1967), which revolutionized the field and served as its paradigm for nearly four decades. This epistemological account not only reviews the intriguing history of island theory, but it also includes fundamental lessons for advancing science through transformative integrations. Indeed, as is likely the case with many disciplines, island theory advanced not as a simple accumulation of facts and an orderly succession of theories and paradigms, but rather in fits and starts through a reticulating phylogeny of ideas and alternating periods of specialization and reintegration. We conclude this review with a summary of the salient features of this scientific revolution in the contest of Kuhn's structure, which strongly influenced theoretical advances during this period, and we then describe some of the fundamental assumptions and tenets of an emerging reintegration of island biogeography theory.},

abstract = {Based on geographical and home range sizes, physiology, and gape limitation, a positive relationship between predator size and diet breadth is expected. Alternatively, larger predators might avoid smaller prey; in this case no relationship would be found. Here, I used a large data set on the diets of marine predators to describe and identify mechanisms responsible for the relationships among predator body size, diet breadth, and the mean, minimum, maximum, and variance of prey size. I found no relationship between predator size and diet breadth. Mean, minimum, maximum, and variance of prey size were all positively associated with predator size. I found that larger predators increase their minimum and maximum prey size with similar slopes, which explains the lack of relationship between predator size and diet breadth. The results support predictions of the hypothesis that optimal foraging is the main factor constraining the shape of the relationships among predator size, prey size, and diet breadth. Future research should focus on examining the relationship between body size and the breadth of different niche axis across different groups of organisms to assess whether a positive relationship between body size and niche breadth is a general rule in macroecology.},

abstract = {There is a recognized need to anticipate tipping points, or critical transitions, in social-ecological systems. Studies of mathematical and experimental systems have shown that systems may 'wobble' before a critical transition. Such early warning signals may be due to the phenomenon of critical slowing down, which causes a system to recover slowly from small impacts, or to a flickering phenomenon, which causes a system to switch back and forth between alternative states in response to relatively large impacts. Such signals for transitions in social-ecological systems have rarely been observed, not the least because high-resolution time series are normally required. Here we combine empirical data from a lake-catchment system with a mathematical model and show that flickering can be detected from sparse data. We show how rising variance coupled to decreasing autocorrelation and skewness started 10-30 years before the transition to eutrophic lake conditions in both the empirical records and the model output, a finding that is consistent with flickering rather than critical slowing down. Our results suggest that if environmental regimes are sufficiently affected by large external impacts that flickering is induced, then early warning signals of transitions in modern social-ecological systems may be stronger, and hence easier to identify, than previously thought.},

abstract = {Abstract. Strong global demand for tropical timber and agricultural products has driven large-scale logging and subsequent conversion of tropical forests. Given that the majority of tropical landscapes have been or will likely be logged, the protection ofbiodiversity within tropical forests thus depends on whether species can persist in these economically exploited lands, and if species cannot persist, whether we can protect enough primary forest from logging and conversion. However, our knowledge of the impact of logging and conversion on biodiversity is limited to a few taxa, often sampled in different locations with complex land-use histories, hampering attempts to plan cost-effective conservation strategies and to draw conclusions across taxa. Spanning a land-use gradient of primary forest, once- and twice-logged forests, and oil palm plantations, we used traditional sampling andDNAmetabarcoding to compile an extensive data set inSabah,MalaysianBorneofornine vertebrate andinvertebrate taxa toquantify thebiological impacts of logging and oil palm, develop cost-effective methods of protecting biodiversity, and examinewhether there is congruence inresponse among taxa.Logged forests retained high species richness, including, on average, 70{\%}of species found in primary forest. In contrast, conversion to oil palmdramatically reduces species richness, with significantly fewer primary-forest species than foundonloggedforest transects for seventaxa.Usinga systematic conservationplanning analysis, we show that efficient protection of primary-forest species is achieved with land portfolios that include a large proportion of logged-forest plots. Protecting logged forests is thus a cost-effective method of protecting an ecologically and taxonomically diverse range of species, particularly when conservation budgets are limited. Six indicator groups (birds, leaf-litter ants, beetles, aerial hymenopterans, flies, and true bugs) proved to be consistently good predictors of the response of the other taxa to logging and oil palm. Our results confidently establish the high conservation value of logged forests and the low value of oil palm. Cross-taxon congruence in responses to disturbance also suggests that the practice of focusing on key indicator taxa yields important information of general biodiversity in studies of logging and oil palm.},

@article{MacArthur1963a,
abstract = {A graphical equilibrium model, balancing immigration and extinction rates of species, has been developed which appears fully consistent with the fauna-area curves and the distance effect seen in land and freshwater bird faunas of the Indo-Australian islands. The establishment of the equilibrium condition allows the development of a more precise zoogeographic theory than hitherto possible. One new and non-obvious prediction can be made from the model which is immediately verifiable from existing data, that the number of species increases with area more rapidly on far islands than on near ones. Similarly, the number of species on large islands decreases with distance faster than does the number of species on small islands. As groups of islands pass from the unsaturated to saturated conditions, the variance-to-mean ratio should change from unity to about one-half. When the faunal buildup reaches 90{\%} of the equilibrium number, the extinction rate in species/year should equal 2.303 times the variance divided by the time (in years) required to reach the 90{\%} level. The implications of this relation are discussed with reference to the Krakatau faunas, where the buildup rate is known. A 'radiation zone,' in which the rate of intra-archipelagic exchange of autochthonous species approaches or exceeds extraarchipelagic immigration toward the outer limits of the taxon's range, is predicted as still another consequence of the equilibrium condition. This condition seems to be fulfilled by conventional information but cannot be rigorously tested with the existing data. Where faunas are at or near equilibrium, it should be possible to devise indirect estimates of the actual immigration and extinction rates, as well as of the times required to reach equilibrium. It should also be possible to estimate the mean dispersal distance of propagules overseas from the zoogeographic data. Mathematical models have been constructed to these ends and certain applications suggested. The main purpose of the paper is to express the criteria and implications of the equilibrium condition, without extending them for the present beyond the IndoAustralian bird faunas.

abstract = {Over the past two decades, comparative biological analyses have undergone profound changes with the incorporation of rigorous evolutionary perspectives and phylogenetic information. This change followed in large part from the realization that traditional methods of statistical analysis tacitly assumed independence of all observations, when in fact biological groups such as species are differentially related to each other according to their evolutionary history. New phylogenetically based analytical methods were then rapidly developed, incorporated into ;the comparative method', and applied to many physiological, biochemical, morphological and behavioral investigations. We now review the rationale for including phylogenetic information in comparative studies and briefly discuss three methods for doing this (independent contrasts, generalized least-squares models, and Monte Carlo computer simulations). We discuss when and how to use phylogenetic information in comparative studies and provide several examples in which it has been helpful, or even crucial, to a comparative analysis. We also consider some difficulties with phylogenetically based statistical methods, and of comparative approaches in general, both practical and theoretical. It is our personal opinion that the incorporation of phylogeny information into comparative studies has been highly beneficial, not only because it can improve the reliability of statistical inferences, but also because it continually emphasizes the potential importance of past evolutionary history in determining current form and function.},

abstract = {Body mass is a fundamental characteristic that affects metabolism, life history, and population abundance and frequently sets bounds on who eats whom in food webs. Based on a collection of topological food webs, Ulrich Brose and colleagues presented a general relationship between the body mass of predators and their prey and analyzed how mean predator-prey body-mass ratios differed among habitats and predator metabolic categories. Here we show that the general body-mass relationship conceals significant variation associated with both predator and prey phylogeny. Major-axis regressions between the log body mass of predators and prey differed among taxonomic groups. The global pattern for Kingdom Animalia had slope {\textgreater} 1, but phyla and classes varied, and several had slopes significantly {\textless} 1. The predator-prey body-mass ratio can therefore decrease or increase with increasing body mass, depending on the taxon considered. We also found a significant phylogenetic signal in analyses of prey body-mass range for predators and predator body-mass range for prey, with stronger signal in the former. Besides providing insights into how characteristics of trophic interactions evolve, our results emphasize the need to integrate phylogeny to improve models of community structure and dynamics or to achieve a metabolic theory of food-web ecology.},

abstract = {A stability analysis of the steady state of marine ecosystems is described. The study was motivated by the approximate invariance of biomass in logarithmic size intervals, which is widely observed in marine ecosystems. This invariance is recovered as the steady state of dynamic models of size spectra, which, unlike traditional species-based models of food webs, explicitly account for the mass gained by an individual organism when it eats a prey item. Little is known about the ecological conditions affecting the stability of the steady state, and a new method is developed to examine this. The results show that stability is enhanced by: (a) decreasing the mean predator-to-prey mass ratio (PPMR), (b) increasing the diet breadth of predators, (c) increasing the strength of intrinsic mortality relative to predation mortality, (d) increasing the biomass conversion efficiency. When perturbed from steady state, size spectra develop a wave-like shape, with an average wavelength especially sensitive to the mean PPMR. These waves move from small to large body size at an average speed which depends on the rate of growth of organisms. In contrast to traditional food web models, stability is enhanced as connectance (diet breadth) increases and as food chain length is increased by reducing the PPMR.},

abstract = {The finding of invariant structures in species interaction webs is of central importance for ecology, with the greatest challenge remaining the elucidation of the processes governing these universal web patterns. Here we quantify the degree of intervality of seven fish-metazoan and 33 mammal-flea webs, i.e., the number of irreducible gaps in parasite diets along the host spectrum, and then challenge the idea that some invariant structures may emerge in host-parasite webs. Using a null model of random links between parasite and host species we find that empirical host-parasite webs exhibit a strong bias toward contiguity of parasite diet, i.e., toward intervality. Going one step further, we demonstrate that a null model with phylogenetic constraints on host-parasite links produced webs very similar to empirical ones, particularly when phylogenetic constraints occur at the family level, that is, when two hosts from the same family are more likely to be infected than two random hosts. In addition, we propose a new standardized measure of intervality which describes a novel "facet" of natural networks as it is independent of connectance or web size. We suggest using this measure as a surrogate of web maturity or saturation as phylogenetic constraints can drive webs toward intervality.},

abstract = {We develop statistical methods for phylogenetic logistic regression in which the dependent variable is binary (0 or 1) and values are nonindependent among species, with phylogenetically related species tending to have the same value of the dependent variable. The methods are based on an evolutionary model of binary traits in which trait values switch between 0 and 1 as species evolve up a phylogenetic tree. The more frequently the trait values switch (i.e., the higher the rate of evolution), the more rapidly correlations between trait values for phylogenetically related species break down. Therefore, the statistical methods also give a way to estimate the phylogenetic signal of binary traits. More generally, the methods can be applied with continuous- and/or discrete-valued independent variables. Using simulations, we assess the statistical properties of the methods, including bias in the estimates of the logistic regression coefficients and the parameter that estimates the strength of phylogenetic signal in the dependent variable. These analyses show that, as with the case for continuous-valued dependent variables, phylogenetic logistic regression should be used rather than standard logistic regression when there is the possibility of phylogenetic correlations among species. Standard logistic regression does not properly account for the loss of information caused by resemblance of relatives and as a result is likely to give inflated type I error rates, incorrectly identifying regression parameters as statistically significantly different from zero when they are not.},

abstract = {Parasitism is the most common animal lifestyle, yet food webs rarely include parasites. The few earlier studies have indicated that including parasites leads to obvious increases in species richness, number of links, and food chain length. A less obvious result was that adding parasites slightly reduced connectance, a key metric considered to affect food web stability. However, reported reductions in connectance after the addition of parasites resulted from an inappropriate calculation. Two alternative corrective approaches applied to four published studies yield an opposite result: parasites increase connectance, sometimes dramatically. In addition, we find that parasites can greatly affect other food web statistics, such as nestedness (asymmetry of interactions), chain length, and linkage density. Furthermore, whereas most food webs find that top trophic levels are least vulnerable to natural enemies, the inclusion of parasites revealed that mid-trophic levels, not low trophic levels, suffered the highest vulnerability to natural enemies. These results show that food webs are very incomplete without parasites. Most notably, recognition of parasite links may have important consequences for ecosystem stability because they can increase connectance and nestedness.},

abstract = {We constructed the food webs of six Mediterranean streams in order to determine ecological generalities derived from analysis of their structure and to explore stabilizing forces within these ecosystems. Fish, macroinvertebrates, primary producers and detritus are the components of the studied food webs. Analysis focused on a suite of food web properties that describe species' trophic habits, linkage complexity and food chains. A great structural similarity was found in analyzed food webs; we therefore suggest average values for the structural properties of Mediterranean stream food webs. Percentage of omnivorous species was positively correlated with connectance, and there was a predominance of intermediate trophic level species that had established simple links with detritus. In short, our results suggest that omnivory and the weak interactions of detritivores have a stabilizing role in these food webs.},

abstract = {One of the oldest ideas in invasion biology, known as Darwin's naturalization hypothesis, suggests that introduced species are more successful in communities in which their close relatives are absent. We conducted the first experimental test of this hypothesis in laboratory bacterial communities varying in phylogenetic relatedness between resident and invading species with and without a protist bacterivore. As predicted, invasion success increased with phylogenetic distance between the invading and the resident bacterial species in both the presence and the absence of protistan bacterivory. The frequency of successful invader establishment was best explained by average phylogenetic distance between the invader and all resident species, possibly indicating limitation by the availability of the unexploited niche (i.e., organic substances in the medium capable of supporting the invader growth); invader abundance was best explained by phylogenetic distance between the invader and its nearest resident relative, possibly indicating limitation by the availability of the unexploited optimal niche (i.e., the subset of organic substances supporting the best invader growth). These results were largely driven by one resident bacterium (a subspecies of Serratia marcescens) posting the strongest resistance to the alien bacterium (another subspecies of S. marcescens). Overall, our findings support phylogenetic relatedness as a useful predictor of species invasion success.},

@article{MacArthur1963,
abstract = {A graphical equilibrium model, balancing immigration and extinction rates of species, has been developed which appears fully consistent with the fauna-area curves and the distance effect seen in land and freshwater bird faunas of the Indo-Australian islands. The establishment of the equilibrium condition allows the development of a more precise zoogeographic theory than hitherto possible. One new and non-obvious prediction can be made from the model which is immediately verifiable from existing data, that the number of species increases with area more rapidly on far islands than on near ones. Similarly, the number of species on large islands decreases with distance faster than does the number of species on small islands. As groups of islands pass from the unsaturated to saturated conditions, the variance-to-mean ratio should change from unity to about one-half. When the faunal buildup reaches 90{\%} of the equilibrium number, the extinction rate in species/year should equal 2.303 times the variance divided by the time (in years) required to reach the 90{\%} level. The implications of this relation are discussed with reference to the Krakatau faunas, where the buildup rate is known. A 'radiation zone,' in which the rate of intra-archipelagic exchange of autochthonous species approaches or exceeds extraarchipelagic immigration toward the outer limits of the taxon's range, is predicted as still another consequence of the equilibrium condition. This condition seems to be fulfilled by conventional information but cannot be rigorously tested with the existing data. Where faunas are at or near equilibrium, it should be possible to devise indirect estimates of the actual immigration and extinction rates, as well as of the times required to reach equilibrium. It should also be possible to estimate the mean dispersal distance of propagules overseas from the zoogeographic data. Mathematical models have been constructed to these ends and certain applications suggested. The main purpose of the paper is to express the criteria and implications of the equilibrium condition, without extending them for the present beyond the IndoAustralian bird faunas.

abstract = {Food webs aim to provide a thorough representation of the trophic interactions found in an ecosystem. The complexity of empirical food webs, however, is leading many ecologists to focus dynamic ecosystem studies on smaller microcosm or mesocosm studies based upon community modules, which comprise three to five species and the interactions likely to have ecological relevance. We provide here a structural counterpart to community modules. We investigate food-web 'motifs' which are n-species connected subgraphs found within the food web. Remarkably, we find that the over- and under-representation of three-species motifs in empirical food webs can be understood through comparison to a static food-web model, the niche model. Our result conclusively demonstrates that predation upon species with some 'characteristic' niche value is the prey selection mechanism consistent with the structural properties of empirical food webs.},

We used standardized techniques to assemble eighteen food webs in streams. Our aim was to identify the determinants of food-web structure with particular reference to energy availability (related to land use), spatial heterogeneity and ecosystem size (both independent of land use). Forested streams displayed lower algal productivity and higher standing crops of organic matter than the grassland streams. The organic matter in the pine streams was probably of lower quality than that elsewhere. Measures of energy availability and spatial heterogeneity predicted species richness and connectance. A combination of energy availability, spatial heterogeneity and ecosystem size accounted for the representation of particular invertebrate feeding groups in the streams. Algal production and organic matter standing crop were important determinants of invertebrate biomass and overall food-web structure. Grassland sites showed a positive relationship between algal productivity and food chain length whereas forest sites displayed a positive relationship between ecosystem size and food chain length. Therefore, these results provide support for both Pimm's productivity hypothesis and Cohen and Newman's ecosystem size hypothesis.},

abstract = {Native pine-forest streams from Maine and North Carolina, USA, and exotic pine-forest streams from New Zealand were compared to assess the effects of geographic location on three aspects of community structure: (1) taxonomic composition, (2) trophic structure (summarized in terms of functional feeding groups), and (3) food web structure (as connectivity food webs). In addition, pine-forest assemblages in New Zealand were compared to assemblages from New Zealand native forest and grassland streams. Taxonomic similarity was, as expected, low for invertebrates, but there were strong similarities in the algal assemblages in different geographic locations. Trophic structure analysis was unable to distinguish either geographic or land-use effects. Food web analysis revealed structural similarities between the pine-forest streams, regardless of location, but there were clear differences among land uses in New Zealand. Pine-forest streams were typified by food webs with few algal species, low internal connectance and a relatively square shape. Grass- land food webs were more triangular in shape and exhibited high internal connectance, while native forest food webs had intermediate characteristics. The results show that the native stream biota, despite a distinct species composition, can adapt to a novel riparian vegetation type and produce trophic and food web structures that are difficult to distinguish from those in the country of origin.},

abstract = {Food webs in the real world are much more complex than food-web literature would have us believe. This is illustrated by the web of the sand community in the Coachella Valley desert. The biota include 174 species of vascular plants, 138 species of vertebrates, more than 55 species of arachnids, and an unknown (but great) number of microorganisms, insects (2,000-3,000 estimated species), acari, and nematodes. Trophic relations are presented in a series of nested subwebs and delineations of the community. Complexity arises from the large number of interactive species, the frequency of omnivory, age structure, looping, the lack of compartmentalization, and the complexity of the arthropod and soil faunas. Web features found in the Coachella also characterize other communities and should produce equivalently complex webs. If anything, diversity and complexity in most nondesert habitats are greater than those in deserts. Patterns from the Coachella web are compared with theoretical predictions and "empirical generalizations" derived from catalogs of published webs. The Coachella web differs greatly: chains are longer, omnivory and loops are not rare, connectivity is greater (species interact with many more predators and prey), top predators are rare or nonexistent, and prey-to-predator ratios are greater than 1.0. The evidence argues that actual community food webs are extraordinarily more complex than those webs cataloged by theorists. I argue that most cataloged webs are oversimplified caricatures of actual communities. That cataloged webs depict so few species, absurdly low ratios of predators on prey and prey eaten by predators, so few links, so little omnivory, a veritable absence of looping, and such a high proportion of top predators argues strongly that they poorly represent real biological communities. Consequently, the practice of abstracting empirical regularities from such catalogs yields an inaccurate and artifactual view of trophic interactions within communities. Contrary to strong assertions by many theorists, patterns from food webs of real communities generally do not support predictions arising from dynamic and graphic models of food-web structure.},

@incollection{Jonsson2005,
abstract = {This chapter demonstrates that methods to describe ecological communities can be better understood, and can reveal new patterns, by labeling each species that appears in a community's food web with the numerical abundance and average body size of individuals of that species. We illustrate our new approach, and relate it to previous approaches, by analyzing data from the pelagic community of a small lake, Tuesday Lake, in Michigan. Although many of the relationships we describe have been well studied individually, we are not aware of any single community for which all of these relationships have been analyzed simultaneously. An overview of some of the results of the present study, with further theoretical extensions, has been published elsewhere (Cohen et al., 2003). Our new approach yields four major results. Though many patterns in the structure of an ecological community have been traditionally treated as independent, they are in fact connected. In at least one real ecosystem, many of these patterns are relatively robust after a major perturbation. Some of these patterns may be predictably consistent from one community to another. Locally, however, some community characteristics need not necessarily coincide with previously reported patterns for guilds or larger geographical scales. We describe our major findings under these headings: trivariate relationships (that is, relationships combining the food web, body size, and species abundance); bivariate relationships; univariate relationships; and the effects of food web perturbation. Trivariate Relationships: Species with small body mass occur low in the food web of Tuesday Lake and are numerically abundant. Larger-bodied species occur higher in the food web and are less numerically abundant. Body size explains more of the variation in numerical abundance than does trophic height. Body mass varies almost 12 orders of magnitude and numerical abundance varies by almost 10 orders of magnitude, but biomass abundance (the product of body mass times numerical abundance) varies by far less, about 5 orders of magnitude. The nearly inverse relationship between body mass and numerical abundance, and the relative constancy of biomass, are illustrated by a new food web graph (Fig. 3), which shows the food web in the plane with axes corresponding to body mass and numerical abundance. Bivariate Relationships: The pelagic community of Tuesday Lake shows a pyramid of numbers but not a pyramid of biomass. The biomass of species increases very slowly with increasing body size, by only 2 orders of magnitude as body mass increases by 12 orders of magnitude. The biomass-body size spectrum is roughly flat, as in other studies at larger spatial scales. Prey body mass is positively correlated to predator body mass. Prey abundance and predator abundance are positively correlated for numerical abundance but not for biomass abundance. Body size and trophic height are positively correlated. Body size and numerical abundance are negatively correlated. The slope of the linear regression of log numerical abundance as a function of log body size in Tuesday Lake is not significantly different from -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4 across all species but is significantly greater than -1 at the 5{\%} significance level. This -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4 slope is similar to that found in studies at larger, regional scales, but different from that sometimes observed at local scales. The slope within the phytoplankton and zooplankton (each group considered separately) is much less steep than -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4, which is in agreement with an earlier observation that the slope tends to be more negative as the range of body masses of the organisms included in a study increases. A novel combination of the food web with data on body size and numerical abundance, together with an argument based on energetic mechanisms, refines and tightens the relationship between numerical abundance and body size. The regression of log body mass as a linear function of log numerical abundance across all species has a slope not significantly different from -1, but significantly less than -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4. The estimated slope is significantly different from the reciprocal of the estimated slope of log numerical abundance as a function of log body mass. Thus, if log body mass is viewed as an independent variable and log numerical abundance is viewed as a dependent variable, the slope of the linear relationship could be -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4 but could not be -1 at the 5{\%} significance level. Conversely, if log numerical abundance is viewed as an independent variable and log body mass as a dependent variable, the slope of the linear relationship could be -1 but could not be -4{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}3 (which is the reciprocal of -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4) at the 5{\%} significance level. While a linear relationship is a good approximation in both cases, Cohen and Carpenter (in press) showed that only the model with log body mass as the independent variable meets the assumptions of linear regression analysis for these data. Univariate Relationships: The food web of Tuesday Lake has a pyramidal trophic structure. The number of trophic links between species in nearby trophic levels is higher than would be expected if trophic links were distributed randomly among the species. Food chains are shorter than would be expected if links were distributed randomly. Species low in the food web tend to have more predators and fewer prey than species high in the web. The distribution of body size is right-log skewed. The rank-numerical abundance relationship is approximately broken-stick within phytoplankton and zooplankton while the rank-biomass abundance relationship is approximately log-normal across all species. The slope of the right tail of the body mass distribution is much less steep than has been suggested for regional scales and not log-uniform as found at local scales for restricted taxonomic groups. Effect of Food Web Perturbation: The data analyzed here were collected in 1984 and 1986. In 1985, three species of planktivorous fishes were removed and one species of piscivorous fish was introduced. The data reveal some differences between 1984 and 1986 in the community's species composition and food web. Most other community characteristics seem insensitive to this major manipulation. Different fields of ecology have focused on different subsets of the bivariate relationships illustrated here. Integration of the relationships as suggested in this chapter could bring these fields closer. The new descriptive data structure (food web plus numerical abundance and body size of each species) can promote the integration of food web studies with, for example, population biology and biogeochemistry. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The food-web communities of two stony tributaries of the Taieri River in New Zealand were documented. We placed heavy emphasis on algal and macroinvertebrate taxonomy, identifying most taxa to species or morpho-species level. Food-web attributes were derived from symmetrical matrices using an Excel macro. The values of the food-web attributes are generally consistent with generalities that have previously been reported in food-web studies, although some hypothesisied relationships between connectance and food-web size did not hold. The patterns detected were robust to the inclusion or exclusion of species that were identified in gut contents but not in field samples. The attributes strongly reflected the trophic status of the streams. Dempsters Creek was classified as autotrophic (based on high primary production and a high ratio of production to respiration) and displayed a larger food-web size and longer food-chains than those seen in Healy Creek, which was classified as hetero-trophic (lower primary production and production to respiration ratio).

abstract = {This data set presents food webs for three North American Pacific coast estuaries and a ‘‘Metaweb'' composed of the species/stages compiled from all three estuaries. The webs have four noteworthy attributes: (1) parasites (infectious agents), (2) body-size information, (3) biomass information, and (4) ontogenetic stages of many animals with complex life cycles. The estuaries are Carpinteria Salt Marsh, California (CSM); Estero de Punta Banda, Baja California (EPB); and Bahı´a Falsa in Bahı´a San Quintı´ n, Baja California (BSQ). Most data on species assemblages and parasitism were gathered via consistent sampling that acquired body size and biomass information for plants and animals larger than ;1 mm, and for many infectious agents (mostly metazoan parasites, but also some microbes). We augmented this with information from additional published sources and by sampling unrepresented groups (e.g., plankton). We estimated free-living consumer–resource links primarily by extending a previously published version of the CSM web (which the current CSM web supplants) and determined most parasite consumer–resource links from direct observation. We recognize 21 possible link types including four general interactions: predators consuming prey, parasites consuming hosts, predators consuming parasites, and parasites consuming parasites. While generally resolved to the species level, we report stage-specific nodes for many animals with complex life cycles. We include additional biological information for each node, such as taxonomy, lifestyle (free-living, infectious, commensal, mutualist), mobility, and residency. The Metaweb includes 500 nodes, 314 species, and 11 270 links projected to be present given appropriate species' co-occurrences. Of these, 9247 links were present in one or more of the estuarine webs. The remaining 2023 links were not present in the estuaries but are included here because they may occur in other places or times. Initial analyses have examined and are examining the interrelationships among consumer strategy, body size, abundance, biomass, trophic level, life stages, and food-web structure and dynamics. Further use of these data may enable a more general exploration how infectious processes and parasites impact communities and ecosystems. Additionally, we present the data and metadata in a standardized format, attempting to provide a system-neutral template for future food-web assembly and publication.},

abstract = {JSTOR is a not-for-profit service that helps scholars, researchers, and students discover, use, and build upon a wide range of content in a trusted digital archive. We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. Abstract. We document the construction of a relatively large food web (44 species) from the island of St. Martin in the northern Lesser Antilles, and compare it with patterns observed in other, generally smaller food webs. In constructing this web, we integrate data from a variety of studies, many of which focussed on Anolis lizards and their vertebrate predators. In addition to determining the links between predators and prey, we estimate the frequencies of predation (the link strengths), and find an approximately bell-shaped distribution with a majority of links of intermediate frequencies. Some of the properties of this web contrast strongly with those of webs in the ECOWeB compilation. In particular, our analysis shows this web to possess an unusual richness of intermediate species (relative to top predators or basal species) and of links between those intermediate species. The number and lengths of chains are also unusually high, as is the degree of omnivory. Nor does this web match the predictions of the cascade model, which predicts even higher proportions of intermediate species and links between them, and even more numerous chains. It appears that these and other differences are not due simply to the large number of species involved here, but it is not yet clear whether they should be ascribed to the completeness with which some of the diets are known, to differences between the ways this and other webs were constructed, or to unique ecological conditions on the island of St. Martin.},

abstract = {Trophic structure of ecosystems is a unifying concept in ecology; however, the quantification of trophic level of individual components has not received the attention one might expect. Ecosystem network analysis provides a format to make several assessments of trophic structure of communities, including the effective trophic level (i.e. non-integer) of these components. We applied network analysis to a Halodule wrightii community in Goose Creek Bay, St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, Florida, USA, during January and February 1994 where we sampled a wide variety of taxa. Unlike most applications of network analysis, the field sampling design was specific for network construction. From these data and literature values, we constructed and analyzed one of the most complex, highly articulated and site specific foodweb networks to be done. Care was taken to structure the network to reflect best the field data and ecology of populations within the requirements of analysis software. This involved establishing internally consistent rules of data manipulation and compartment aggregation. Special attention was paid to the microbial components of the food web. Consumer compartments comprised effective trophic levels from 2.0 (herbivore/detritivore) to 4.32 (where a level 4.0 represents 'secondary carnivory'), and these values were used to organize data interpretation. The effective trophic levels of consumers tended to aggregate near integer values, but the spread from integer values increased with increasing level. Detritus and benthic microalgae acted as important sources of food in the extended diets of many consumers. 'Bottom-up' control appeared important through mixed trophic impact analysis, and the extent of positive impacts decreased with increasing trophic level. 'Top-down' control was limited to a few consumers with relatively large production or biomass relative to their trophic position. Overall, ordering results from various network analysis algorithms by effective trophic level proved useful in highlighting the potential influence of different taxa to trophodynamics. Although the calculation of effective trophic level has been available for some time, its application to the evaluation of other analyses has previously not received due consideration.},

abstract = {Indirect trophic effects play important roles in eco- system dynamics and can at times oppose and dominate the action of direct feeding linkages. Each predator directly exerts a negative effect upon its prey, but predators may also provide indirect ben- efits to their prey. In ecosystems, such benefits are effected via indirect trophic pathways that can provide a more than compensating positive influ- ence. The ecosystem of the Big Cypress National Preserve (southwest Florida) appears to contain an unusually high number of such predators—most notably, the American alligator, Alligator mississippi- ensis. The trophic exchanges of carbon among the 68 principal taxa comprising the cypress wetland eco- system have been quantified during both wet and dry seasons. The network analysis program IMPACTS identified predators that potentially have a positive influence on some of their prey. A total of 64 of these instances were recorded for the wet season and 44 for the dry. Taxa that, on balance, have positive effects upon their prey include fishes, turtles, snakes, birds, and, most significantly, alliga- tors. The feeding habits of alligators benefit a con- spicuous number (11) of their prey (invertebrates, frogs, mice, and rats). Further trophic analysis re- veals that the predation by alligators on snakes and turtles accounts for most of the trophic benefits bestowed. The actions of alligators in modifying their physical environment has been cited else- where as contributing to the maintenance of biotic diversity. It appears that the trophic influence of this species adds further evidence to the important role it plays in the functional ecology of the cypress wetland.},

abstract = {Aquatic endotherms living in polar regions are faced with a multitude of challenges, including low air and water temperatures and low illumination, especially in winter. Like other endotherms from cold environments, Great Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) living in Arctic waters were hypothesized to respond to these challenges through a combination of high daily rate of energy expenditure (DEE) and high food requirements, which are met by a high rate of catch per unit effort (CPUE). CPUE has previously been shown in Great Cormorants to be the highest of any diving bird. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by making the first measurements of DEE and foraging activity of Arctic-dwelling Great Cormorants throughout the annual cycle. We demonstrate that, in fact, Great Cormorants have surprisingly low rates of DEE. This low DEE is attributed primarily to very low levels of foraging activity, particularly during winter, when the cormorants spent only 2{\%} of their day submerged. Such a low level of foraging activity can only be sustained through consistently high foraging performance. We demonstrate that Great Cormorants have one of the highest recorded CPUEs for a diving predator; 18.6 g per minute submerged (95{\%} prediction interval 13.0-24.2 g/min) during winter. Temporal variation in CPUE was investigated, and highest CPUE was associated with long days and shallow diving depths. The effect of day length is attributed to seasonal variation in prey abundance. Shallow diving leads to high CPUE because less time is spent swimming between the surface and the benthic zone where foraging occurs. Our study demonstrates the importance of obtaining accurate measurements of physiology and behavior from free-living animals when attempting to understand their ecology.},

I first investigate topological explanations in the case of ecological research on the stability of ecosystems. Then I contrast them with mechanistic explanations, thereby distinguishing the kind of realization they involve from the realization relations entailed by mechanistic explanations, and explain how both kinds of explanations may be articulated in practice. The second section, expanding on the case of ecological stability, considers the phenomenon of robustness at all levels of the biological hierarchy in order to show that topological explanations are indeed pervasive there. Reasons are suggested for this, in which "neutral network" explanations are singled out as a form of topological explanation that spans across many levels. Finally, I appeal to the distinction of explanatory regimes to cast light on a controversy in philosophy of biology, the issue of contingence in evolution, which is shown to essentially involve issues about realization.},

abstract = {Optimal-foraging theory, specifically the ‘‘Time-Limited Disperser Model,'' predicts that animals that can search for resources for a long period will be specialists, whereas animals that have limited search times will be generalists. So far, this model has only been tested within individual species, i.e., among animals of similar physiology and life history. I tested the model across multiple species, using a taxonomically diverse community of arthropods found on exposed tree trunks in northern Germany. I sampled 14 arthropod species from different microhabitat types (various cryptogam species and crevice types) and quantified the microhabitat-niche breadths of species by Simpson index. Then, I used multiple regression analysis across phylogenetically independent contrasts to examine the relationship between microhabitat-niche breadth and traits that can control search time (degree of residence on the trunks, tolerance of abiotic stress, speed of move- ment, generation time). I found that microhabitat specialists had longer generation times, spent more of their life on the trunks and could move faster than generalists. This allowed specialists to search the trunk for a longer period of time than generalists and to require less time to traverse a given search distance. These three findings supported the Time- Limited Disperser Model. However, specialists were no more tolerant of abiotic stress (i.e., desiccation) than were generalists. That is, specialists could not search the trunk during more adverse climatic conditions than could generalists, contradicting the Time-Limited Disperser Model. Overall, the results supported three out of four predictions of the Time- Limited Disperser Model at an interspecific level. Specialists can search for a long time; generalists are pressed for time},

Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.},

abstract = {Analyses of temporal patterns of diversity across a wide range of taxa have found that more diverse communities often show smaller compositional changes over time. This generality indicates that high diversity is associated with greater temporal stability in species composition. We examined patterns of diversity and community stability in zooplankton time series data from 36 lakes sampled over a combined 483 years. The species-time relationship was flatter in more species-rich lakes in the temperate zone. However, high-latitude lakes had both low richness and low turnover. These patterns were consistent for turnover both within and among years. Daily, annual and long-term richness were all higher in large lakes while turnover was unaffected by the surface area. Richness on all time scales, as well as turnover within and among years, all declined at high latitude. Species-area relations and latitudinal gradients in richness therefore reflect different temporal components of diversity. Our results suggest that diversity shows strong associations with compositional stability that vary qualitatively across biogeographical provinces. Community stability increases with diversity among lakes in the temperate zone; however, the two are negatively correlated across latitudinal gradients. These patterns indicate that either the direct effects of diversity on stability or their covariance with environmental fluctuations vary with latitude.},

abstract = {The topology of ecological interaction webs holds important information for theories of coevolution, biodiversity, and ecosystem stability [1-6]. However, most previous network analyses solely counted the number of links and ignored variation in link strength. Because of this crude resolution, results vary with scale and sampling intensity, thus hampering a comparison of network patterns at different levels [7-9]. We applied a recently developed [10] quantitative and scale-independent analysis based on information theory to 51 mutualistic plant-animal networks, with interaction frequency as measure of link strength. Most networks were highly structured, deviating significantly from random associations. The degree of specialization was independent of network size. Pollination webs were significantly more specialized than seed-dispersal webs, and obligate symbiotic ant-plant mutualisms were more specialized than nectar-mediated facultative ones. Across networks, the average specialization of animal and plants was correlated, but is constrained by the ratio of plant to animal species involved. In pollination webs, rarely visited plants were on average more specialized than frequently attended ones, whereas specialization of pollinators was positively correlated with their interaction frequency. We conclude that quantitative specialization in ecological communities mirrors evolutionary trade-offs and constraints of web architecture. This approach can be easily expanded to other types of biological interactions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We examined how large seasonal influxes of migratory prey influenced population dynamics of arctic foxes and how this varied with fluctuations in small mammal (lemming and vole) abundance—the main prey of arctic foxes throughout most of their range. Specifically, we compared how arctic fox abundance, breeding density and litter size varied inside and outside a large goose colony and in relation to annual variation in small mammal abundance. Information-theoretic model selection showed that (1) breeding density and fox abundance were 2–3 times higher inside the colony than they were outside the colony and (2) litter size, breeding density and annual variation in fox abundance in the colony tracked fluctuations in lemming abundance. The influence of lemming abundance on reproduction and abundance of arctic foxes outside the colony was inconclusive, largely because fox densities outside the colony were low, which made it difficult to detect such relationships. Lemming abundance was, thus, the main factor governing reproduction and abundance of arctic foxes in the colony, whereas seasonal influxes of geese and their eggs provided foxes with external subsidies that elevated breeding density and fox abundance above that which lemmings could support. This study highlights (1) the relative importance of migratory prey and other foods on the abundance and reproduction by local consumers and (2) how migratory animals function as vectors of nutrient transfer between distant ecosystems such as Arctic environments and wintering areas by geese thousands of kilometres to the south.},

abstract = {Species extinctions pose serious threats to the functioning of ecological communities worldwide. We used two qualitative and quantitative pollination networks to simulate extinction patterns following three removal scenarios: random removal and systematic removal of the strongest and weakest interactors. We accounted for pollinator behaviour by including potential links into temporal snapshots (12 consecutive 2-week networks) to reflect mutualists' ability to 'switch' interaction partners (re-wiring). Qualitative data suggested a linear or slower than linear secondary extinction while quantitative data showed sigmoidal decline of plant interaction strength upon removal of the strongest interactor. Temporal snapshots indicated greater stability of re-wired networks over static systems. Tolerance of generalized networks to species extinctions was high in the random removal scenario, with an increase in network stability if species formed new interactions. Anthropogenic disturbance, however, that promote the extinction of the strongest interactors might induce a sudden collapse of pollination networks.},

abstract = {A long-standing question in community ecology is whether food webs are organized in compartments, where species within the same compartment interact frequently among themselves, but show fewer interactions with species from other compartments. Finding evidence for this community organization is important since compartmentalization may strongly affect food web robustness to perturbation. However, few studies have found unequivocal evidence of compartments, and none has quantified the suite of mechanisms generating such a structure. Here, we combine computational tools from the physics of complex networks with phylogenetic statistical methods to show that a large marine food web is organized in compartments, and that body size, phylogeny, and spatial structure are jointly associated with such a compartmentalized structure. Sharks account for the majority of predatory interactions within their compartments. Phylogenetically closely related shark species tend to occupy different compartments and have divergent trophic levels, suggesting that competition may play an important role structuring some of these compartments. Current overfishing of sharks has the potential to change the structural properties, which might eventually affect the stability of the food web.},

Conventional wisdom holds that either resource availability or dynamical stability limit food-chain length; however, new studies and new techniques challenge the conventional wisdom and broaden the discourse on food-chain length. Recent results suggest that resource availability limits food-chain length only in systems with very low resource availability, and call into question the theoretical basis for dynamical stability as a determinant of food-chain length. Evidence currently points towards a complex and contingent framework of interacting constraints that includes the history of community organization, resource availability, the type of predator-prey interactions, disturbance and ecosystem size. Within this framework, the debate has shifted from a search for singular explanations to a search for when and where different constraints operate to determine food-chain length.},

abstract = {The efficiency of energy transfer through food chains [food chain efficiency (FCE)] is an important ecosystem function. It has been hypothesized that FCE across multiple trophic levels is constrained by the efficiency at which herbivores use plant energy, which depends on plant nutritional quality. Furthermore, the number of trophic levels may also constrain FCE, because herbivores are less efficient in using plant production when they are constrained by carnivores. These hypotheses have not been tested experimentally in food chains with 3 or more trophic levels. In a field experiment manipulating light, nutrients, and food-chain length, we show that FCE is constrained by algal food quality and food-chain length. FCE across 3 trophic levels (phytoplankton to carnivorous fish) was highest under low light and high nutrients, where algal quality was best as indicated by taxonomic composition and nutrient stoichiometry. In 3-level systems, FCE was constrained by the efficiency at which both herbivores and carnivores converted food into production; a strong nutrient effect on carnivore efficiency suggests a carryover effect of algal quality across 3 trophic levels. Energy transfer efficiency from algae to herbivores was also higher in 2-level systems (without carnivores) than in 3-level systems. Our results support the hypothesis that FCE is strongly constrained by light, nutrients, and food-chain length and suggest that carryover effects across multiple trophic levels are important. Because many environmental perturbations affect light, nutrients, and food-chain length, and many ecological services are mediated by FCE, it will be important to apply these findings to various ecosystem types.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract Despite the development of diversity indices in community ecology that incorporate both richness and evenness, pollination biologists commonly use only pollinator richness to estimate generalization. Similarly, while pollination biologists have stressed the utility of pollinator importance, incorporating both pollinator abundance and effectiveness, importance values have not been included in estimates of generalization in pol lination systems. In this study, we estimated pollinator generalization for 17 plant species using Simpson's diversity index, which includes richness and evenness. We compared these estimates with estimates based on only pollinator richness, and compared diversity esti mates calculated using importance data with those using only visitation data. We found that pollinator richness explains only 57-65{\%} of the variation in diversity, and that, for most plant species, pollinator importance was determined primarily by differences in visitation rather than by differences in effectiveness. While simple rich ness may suffice for broad comparisons of pollinator generalization, measures that incorporate evenness will provide a much more accurate understanding of gener alization. Although incorporating labor-intensive mea surements of pollinator effectiveness are less necessary for broad surveys, effectiveness estimates will be impor tant for detailed studies of some plant species. Unfor tunately, at this point it is impossible to predict a priori which species these are.},

abstract = {Most tropical woody plants produce new leaves and flowers in bursts rather than continuously, and most tropical forest communities display seasonal variation in the presence of new leaves, flowers, and fruits. This patterning suggests that phenological changes represent adaptations to either biotic or abiotic factors. Biotic factors may select for either a staggering or a clustering of the phenological activity of individual plant species. We review the evidence for several hypotheses. The idea that plant species can reduce predation by synchronizing their phenological activity has the best support. However, because biotic factors are often arbitrary with respect to the timing of these peaks, it is essential also to consider abiotic influences. A review of published studies demonstrates a major role for climate. Peaks in irradiance are accompanied by peaks in flushing and flowering except where water stress makes this impossible. Thus, in seasonally dry forests, many plants concentrate leafing and flowering around the start of the rainy season; they also tend to fruit at the same time, probably to minimize seedling mortality during the subsequent dry season. Phenological variation at the level of the forest community affects primary consumers who respond by dietary switching, seasonal breeding, changes in range use, or migration. During periods of scarcity, certain plant products, keystone resources, act as mainstays of the primary consumer community.},

abstract = {Ecological networks are complexes of interacting species, but not all potential links among species are realized. Unobserved links are either missing or forbidden. Missing links exist, but require more sampling or alternative ways of detection to be verified. Forbidden links remain unobservable, irrespective of sampling effort. They are caused by linkage constraints. We studied one Arctic pollination network and two Mediterranean seed-dispersal networks. In the first, for example, we recorded flower-visit links for one full season, arranged data in an interaction matrix and got a connectance C of 15 per cent. Interaction accumulation curves documented our sampling of interactions through observation of visits to be robust. Then, we included data on pollen from the body surface of flower visitors as an additional link 'currency'. This resulted in 98 new links, missing from the visitation data. Thus, the combined visit-pollen matrix got an increased C of 20 per cent. For the three networks, C ranged from 20 to 52 per cent, and thus the percentage of unobserved links (100 - C) was 48 to 80 per cent; these were assumed forbidden because of linkage constraints and not missing because of under-sampling. Phenological uncoupling (i.e. non-overlapping phenophases between interacting mutualists) is one kind of constraint, and it explained 22 to 28 per cent of all possible, but unobserved links. Increasing phenophase overlap between species increased link probability, but extensive overlaps were required to achieve a high probability. Other kinds of constraint, such as size mismatch and accessibility limitations, are briefly addressed.},

abstract = {1. To examine spatial heterogeneity of trophic pathways on a small scale ({\textless}5 m diameter), we conducted dual stable isotope (d13C and d15N) analyses of invertebrate communities and their potential food sources in three patchy habitats [sphagnum lawn (SL), vascular- plant carpet (VC) and sphagnum carpet] within a temperate bog (Mizorogaike Pond, Kyoto, Japan). 2. In total, 19 invertebrate taxa were collected from the three habitats, most of which were stenotopic, i.e. collected from a single habitat. Amongst the habitats, significant variation was observed in the isotopic signatures of dominant plant tissues and their detrital matter [benthic particulate organic matter (BPOM)], both of which were potential organic food sources for invertebrates. Site-specific isotopic variation amongst detritivores was found in d13C but not in d15N, reflecting site-specificity in the isotopic signatures of basal foods. The eurytopic hydrophilid beetle Helochares striatus was found in all habitats, but showed clear site variation in its isotopic signatures, suggesting that it strongly relies on foods within its own habitat. 3. The most promising potential foods for detritivores were the dead leaf stalks of a dominant plant in the VC and BPOM in the SL and carpet. An isotopic mixing model (IsoSource version 1.3.1) estimated that aquatic predators rely on unknown trophic sources with higher d13C than detritus, whereas terrestrial predators forage on allochthonous as well as autochthonous prey, suggesting that the latter predators might play key roles in coupling between habitats. 4. Our stable isotope approach revealed that immobile detritivores are confined to their small patchy habitats but that heterogeneous trophic pathways can be coupled by mobile predators, stressing the importance of habitat heterogeneity and predator coupling in characterising food webs in bog ecosystems.},

It is thought that a community's resilience depends crucially on the food web-the network of trophic interactions-and on the food web's degree of compartmentalization. Despite its ecological importance, compartmentalization and the mechanisms that give rise to it remain poorly understood. Here we investigate several definitions of compartments, propose ways to understand the ecological meaning of these definitions, and quantify the degree of compartmentalization of empirical food webs. We find that the compartmentalization observed in empirical food webs can be accounted for solely by the niche organization of species and their diets. By uncovering connections between compartmentalization and species' diet contiguity, our findings help us understand which perturbations can result in fragmentation of the food web and which can lead to catastrophic effects. Additionally, we show that the composition of compartments can be used to address the long-standing question of what determines the ecological niche of a species.},

The last concept refers to the absence of structural bottlenecks in the food web, whose removal separate the network into large isolate clusters. In theory networks with identical connectance can display different expansibility characteristics. Using the spectral scaling method we studied 17 food networks and classified them as good expansion (GE) and not-GE networks. The combination of GE properties and degree distribution of species permitted the classification of food webs into six different classes. These classes characterize the differences in robustness of food webs to species loss. While the webs having uniform degree distributions and displaying GE properties are the most robust to species loss, the presence of bottlenecks and skewed distribution of the number of links per species make food webs very vulnerable to primary removal of species. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A relationship between diversity and stability was proposed by MacArthur [MacArthur, R.H., 1955. Fluctuation of animal populations and a measure of community stability. Ecology 36, 533-536.]. Current thinking (for example, McCann, K., 2000. The diversity-stability debate. Nature 405, 228-233.) acknowledges that interaction pattern among species, rather than species richness per se, is one element of this relationship. Dunne et al. [Dunne, J.A., Williams, R.J., Martinez, N.D., 2002a. Network structure and biodiversity loss in food webs: robustness increases with connectance. Ecol. Lett. 5, 558-567.] showed that the robustness of 16 food webs is correlated with their connectance. Connectance is one measure of interaction pattern. Robustness relates to the maintenance of network integrity and so has consequences for stability; the loss of integrity must have ecosystem-wide implications. This paper tests the hypothesis that changes in a food web's connectance indicate changes in its robustness. It concludes that any change in connectance with species loss, but especially large, negative changes, constitutes a decrease in robustness. Estimation of the change in connectance could support interpretation of monitoring data on species composition, acting as an indicator of food web robustness and, indirectly, of ecosystem stability. It could assist managers to understand the implications of biodiversity loss caused by human intervention in ecosystems, and could assist either choice of intervention or amelioration of impacts. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We constructed plots of 200 m × 5 m in two distinct habitats on the islands of Dominica, Grenada and Puerto Rico (total of six plots) and recorded visitors to all plant species in flower. In total we recorded 447 interactions among 144 plants and 226 pollinator species. Specifically we describe how rainfall and temperature affect proportional richness and importance of the different pollinator functional groups. We used three measures of pollinator importance: number of interactions, number of plant species visited and betweenness centrality. Overall rainfall explained most of the variation in pollinator richness and relative importance. Bird pollination tended to increase with rainfall, although not significantly, whereas insects were significantly negatively affected by rainfall. However, the response among insect groups was more complex; bees were strongly negatively affected by rainfall, whereas dipterans showed similar trends to birds. Bird, bee and dipteran variation along the climate gradient can be largely explained by their physiological capabilities to respond to rainfall and temperature, but the effect of climate on other insect pollinator groups was more obscure. This study contributes to the understanding of how climate may affect neotropical plant-pollinator communities},

abstract = {Degree distributions are widely used to characterize networks, including food webs, and play a vital role in models of food web structure. To date, there have been no mechanistic or statistical explanations for the form of food web degree distributions. Here, I introduce models for food web degree distributions based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and show that the distributions of the number of consumers and resources in 23 (45{\%}) and 35 (69{\%}) of 51 food webs are not significantly different at a 95{\%} confidence level from the MaxEnt distribution. These findings offer a new null model for the most probable degree distributions in food webs and other networks. They suggest that there is relatively little pressure favoring generalist or specialist consumption strategies but that biological drivers or methodological bias may force the consumer distribution away from the MaxEnt form.},

abstract = {1. Model analyses show that the stability of population dynamics and food web persistence increase with the strength of interference competition. Despite this critical importance for community stability, little is known about how external factors such as the environmental temperature affect intraspecific interference competition. 2. We aimed to fill this void by studying the functional responses of two ground beetle species of different body size, Pterostichus melanarius and Poecilus versicolor. These functional response experiments were replicated across four predator densities and two temperatures to address the impact of temperature on intraspecific interference competition. 3. We generally expected that warming should increase the speed of movement, encounter rates and in consequence interference among predator individuals. In our experiment, this expectation was supported by the results obtained for the larger predator, P. melanarius, whereas the opposite pattern characterized the interference behaviour of the smaller predator P. versicolor. 4. These results suggest potentially nontrivial implications for the effects of environmental temperature on intraspecific interference competition, for which we propose an explanation based on the different sensitivity to warming of metabolic rates of both species. As expected, increasing temperature led to stronger interference competition of the larger species, P. melanarius, which exhibited a weaker increase in metabolic rate with increasing temperature. The stronger increase in the metabolic rate of the smaller predator, P. versicolor, had to be compensated by increasing searching activity for prey, which did not leave time for increasing interference. 5. Together, these results suggest that any generalization how interference competition responds to warming should also take the species' metabolic response to temperature increases into account.},

Disturbance is known to impact community structure, but its effect on food chain length is still a matter of considerable debate. Theoretical models show that longer food chains are less resilient to disturbance, so food chain length is predicted to be shorter following a disturbance event. Here we experimentally test the effect of disturbance on food chain length in streams by diverting stream flow. We found that our experimental low-flow disturbance did not alter food chain length. We did see an effect on body-size structure in our food webs suggesting that food chain length may be an insensitive indicator of disturbance. We suggest that habitat heterogeneity and food web complexity buffer the effect of disturbance on food chain length. The theoretical predictions of disturbance on food chain length are only likely to be seen in homogeneous systems that closely approximate the linear food chains the models are based upon.},

abstract = {Pollination networks are representations of all interactions between co-existing plants and their flower visiting animals at a given site. Although the study of networks has become a distinct sub-discipline in pollination biology, few studies have attempted to quantify spatio-temporal variation in species composition and structure of networks. We here investigate patterns of year-to-year change in pollination networks from six different sites spanning a large latitudinal gradient. We quantified level of species persistence and interactions among years, and examined year-to-year variation of network structural parameters in relation to latitude and sampling effort. In addition, we tested for correlations between annual variation in network parameters and short and long-term climate change variables. Numbers of plant and animal species and interactions were roughly constant from one year to another at all sites. However, composition of species and interactions changed from one year to another. Turnover was particularly high for flower visitors and interactions. On the other hand, network structural parameters (connectance, nestedness, modularity and centralization) remained remarkably constant between years, regardless of network size and latitude. Inter-annual variation of network parameters was not related to short or long term variation in climate variables (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation). We thus conclude that pollination networks are highly dynamic and variable in composition of species and interactions among years. However, general patterns of network structure remain constant, indicating that species may be replaced by topologically similar species. These results suggest that pollination networks are to some extent robust against factors affecting species occurrences},

abstract = {Aim Studies comparing feeding habits across a genus in different geographical regions or habitats can identify factors associated with adaptive feeding behaviour, linking key ecological traits between consumers and their environment. We investigated biogeographical patterns in dietary composition and trophic diversity across the genus Martes in relation to geographical range and environmental variables. We hypothesized that widely distributed opportunistic Martes species should demonstrate adaptive variations in dietary composition and trophic diversity relative to regional geographical location (e.g. latitude, elevation), environmental variation (e.g. temperature, rainfall, snow cover and primary productivity) and concomitant variation in food supply. Location Europe, Asia and North America. Methods We examined the dietary habits of martens (Martes spp.) using original data expressed as relative frequency of occurrence, and using principal components analysis to extract the main gradients in diet composition. These were then used as response variables in regression analyses, predicted from latitude or elevation. Multiple regression analyses were performed to assess the influence of food types and environmental variables on the trophic diversity index. Results A clear latitudinal gradient in dietary composition was observed. Small mammals were the primary food type, but were less abundant in the diet of martens at lower latitude and elevation. Vegetable matter and insects were consumed more frequently in southerly and/or lower-elevation localities. Trophic diversity was lower at higher elevation, and increased with a decline in consumption of the dominant food types, i.e. rodents, fruits and insects. Trophic diversity also increased with increasing mean temperature. Main conclusions Biogeographical variations in feeding habits across the genus Martes proved to be associated with latitude, local climate (especially temperature regime) and the availability of alternative potential foods. On an extensive geographical scale, martens respond to varying food availability by adjusting their foraging strategy and thus should be considered facultative generalists. At the species level, however, different climatic variables emerged as differentially important, indicative of adaptations to local conditions. Martes species are opportunistic and flexible feeders, and thus their conservation requires informed management, mindful of how changes in environmental conditions might influence their varied food supply.},

abstract = {Vole dynamics in northern Europe exhibit a well-defined geographical gradient, with oscillatory populations being confined to high latitudes. It has been proposed that oscillations in northern vole populations are driven by their interaction with specialist predators (weasels), while the more southern rodent populations are relatively stable because of regulation by generalist predators. We tested this generalist/specialist predation hypothesis by constructing an empirically based model for vole population dynamics, estimating its parameters, and making predictions about the quantitative pattern of the latitudinal shift in vole dynamics. Our results indicated that the model accurately predicted the latitudinal shift in the amplitude and periodicity of population fluctuations. Moreover, the model predicted that vole dynamics should shift from stable to chaotic as latitude is increased, a result in agreement with nonlinear time-series analysis of the data. The striking success of the model at predicting the shifts in amplitude and stability along the geographical gradient in northern Europe provides strong support for the key role of specialist and generalist predators in vole population dynamics.},

At local scales biodiversity may act as a barrier to invasion; however, the mechanism by which biodiversity confers invasion resistance to a community has been the subject of considerable debate. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that productivity and diversity affected the ability of a regionally available species to colonize communities from which it is absent. We hypothesized that the invasibility of rock pool invertebrate communities would increase with increasing nutrients and decrease with increasing diversity. We tested this possibility using naturally invaded outdoor aquatic microcosms. We demonstrated that the invasibility of an experimental multi-trophic aquatic community by a competitive native midge species (Ceratopogonidae: Dasyhelea sp.) was determined by an interaction between resource availability, diversity, and the densities of two competitive ostracods species. Nutrient enrichment increased invasion success; however, within nutrient-enriched microcosms, invasion success was highest in the low-diversity treatments. Our results suggest that resource availability may in fact be the principal mechanism determining invasibility at local scales in multi-trophic rock pool communities; however resource availability can be determined by both nutrient input as well as by the diversity of the biotic community.},

abstract = {Productivity influences the availability of resources for colonizing species. Biodiversity may also influence invasibility of communities because of more complete use of resource types with increasing species richness. We hypothesized that communities with higher environmental productivity and lower species richness should be more invasible by a competitor than those where productivity is low or where richness is high.We experimentally examined the invasion resistance of herbivorous meiofauna of Jamaican rock pools by a competitor crustacean (Ostracoda: Potamocypris sp. (Brady)) by contrasting three levels of nutrient input and four levels of species richness. Although relative abundance (dominance) of the invasive was largely unaffected by resource availability, increasing resources did increase the success rate of establishment. Effects of species richness on dominance were more pronounced with a trend towards the lowest species richness treatment of 2 resident species being more invasible than those with 4, 6, or 7 species. These results can be attributed to a ?sampling effect' associated with the introduction of Alona davidii (Richard) into the higher biodiversity treatments. Alona dominated the communities where it established and precluded dominance by the introduced ostracod. Our experimental study supports the idea that niche availability and community interactions define community invasibility and does not support the application of a neutral community model for local food web management where predictions of exotic species impacts are needed.},

abstract = {With global freshwater biodiversity declining at an even faster rate than in the most disturbed terrestrial ecosystems, understanding the effects of changing environmental conditions on relationships between biodiversity and the variability of community and population processes in aquatic ecosystems is of significant interest. Evidence is accumulating that biodiversity loss results in more variable communities; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect have been the subject of considerable debate. We manipulated species richness and nutrients in outdoor aquatic microcosms composed of naturally occurring assemblages of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates to determine how the relationship between species richness and variability might change under different nutrient conditions. Temporal variability of populations and communities decreased with increasing species richness in low nutrient microcosms. In contrast, we found no relationship between species richness and either population or community variability in nutrient enriched microcosms. Of the different mechanisms we investigated (e.g. overyielding, statistical averaging, insurance effects, and the stabilizing effect of species richness on populations) the only one that was consistent with our results was that increases in species richness led to more stable community abundances through the stabilizing effect of species richness on the component populations. While we cannot conclusively determine the mechanism(s) by which species richness stabilized populations, our results suggest that more complete resource-use in the more species-rich low nutrient communities may have dampened population fluctuations.},

abstract = {A central and perhaps insurmountable challenge of invasion ecology is to predict which combinations of species and habitats most effectively promote and prevent biological invasions. Here, we integrate models of network structure and nonlinear population dynamics to search for potential generalities among trophic factors that may drive invasion success and failure. We simulate invasions where 100 different species attempt to invade 150 different food webs with 15-26 species and a wide range (0.06-0.32) of connectance. These simulations yield 11 438 invasion attempts by non-basal species, 47 per cent of which are successful. At the time of introduction, whether or not the invader is a generalist best predicts final invasion success; however, once the invader establishes itself, it is best distinguished from unsuccessful invaders by occupying a lower trophic position and being relatively invulnerable to predation. In general, variables that reflect the interaction between an invading species and its new community, such as generality and trophic position, best predict invasion success; however, for some trophic categories of invaders, fundamental species traits, such as having the centre of the feeding range low on the theoretical niche axis (for non-omnivorous and omnivorous herbivores), or the topology of the food web (for tertiary carnivores), best predict invasion success. Across all invasion scenarios, a discriminant analysis model predicted successful and failed invasions with 76.5 per cent accuracy for properties at the time of introduction or 100 per cent accuracy for properties at the time of establishment. More generally, our results suggest that tackling the challenge of predicting the properties of species and habitats that promote or inhibit invasions from food web perspective may aid ecologists in identifying rules that govern invasions in natural ecosystems.},

This enables tests of theory pertaining to spatial and temporal dynamics, for example, the effects of neighboring communities on local diversity, or the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem function. Using examples, we comment on the position of natural microcosms in the roster of ecological research strategies and tools.

To prove this point, he analyzed large networks in which species interact at random. However, in natural systems pairs of species have well-defined interactions (e.g., predator-prey, mutualistic or competitive). Here we extend May's results to these relationships and find remarkable differences between predator-prey interactions, which increase stability, and mutualistic and competitive, which are destabilizing. We provide analytic stability criteria for all cases. These results have broad applicability in ecology. For example, we show that, surprisingly, the probability of stability for predator-prey networks is decreased when we impose realistic food web structure or we introduce a large preponderance of weak interactions. Similarly, stability is negatively impacted by nestedness in bipartite mutualistic networks.},

abstract = {Large-scale geographical patterns of biotic specialization and the underlying drivers are poorly understood, but it is widely believed that climate plays an important role in determining specialization. As climate-driven range dynamics should diminish local adaptations and favor generalization, one hypothesis is that contemporary biotic specialization is determined by the degree of past climatic instability, primarily Quaternary climate-change velocity. Other prominent hypotheses predict that either contemporary climate or species richness affect biotic specialization. To gain insight into geographical patterns of contemporary biotic specialization and its drivers, we use network analysis to determine the degree of specialization in plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks sampled at 31 localities, spanning a wide range of climate regimes across the Americas. We found greater biotic specialization at lower latitudes, with latitude explaining 20-22{\%} of the spatial variation in plant-hummingbird specialization. Potential drivers of specialization--contemporary climate, Quaternary climate-change velocity, and species richness--had superior explanatory power, together explaining 53-64{\%} of the variation in specialization. Notably, our data provides empirical evidence for the hypothesized roles of species richness, contemporary precipitation and Quaternary climate-change velocity as key predictors of biotic specialization, whereas contemporary temperature and seasonality seem unimportant in determining specialization. These results suggest that both ecological and evolutionary processes at Quaternary time scales can be important in driving large-scale geographical patterns of contemporary biotic specialization, at least for co-evolved systems such as plant-hummingbird networks.},

abstract = {The degree of interdependence and potential for shared coevolutionary history of frugivorous animals and fleshy-fruited plants are contentious topics. Recently, network analyses revealed that mutualistic relationships between fleshy-fruited plants and frugivores are mostly built upon generalized associations. However, little is known about the determinants of network structure, especially from tropical forests where plants' dependence on animal seed dispersal is particularly high. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of specialization and interaction strength in a plant-frugivore network from a Kenyan rain forest. We recorded fruit removal from 33 plant species in different forest strata (canopy, midstory, understory) and habitats (primary and secondary forest) with a standardized sampling design (3447 interactions in 924 observation hours). We classified the 88 frugivore species into guilds according to dietary specialization (14 obligate, 28 partial, 46 opportunistic frugivores) and forest dependence (50 forest species, 38 visitors). Overall, complementary specialization was similar to that in other plant-frugivore networks. However, the plant-frugivore interactions in the canopy stratum were less specialized than in the mid- and understory, whereas primary and secondary forest did not differ. Plant specialization on frugivores decreased with plant height, and obligate and partial frugivores were less specialized than opportunistic frugivores. The overall impact of a frugivore increased with the number of visits and the specialization on specific plants. Moreover, interaction strength of frugivores differed among forest strata. Obligate frugivores foraged in the canopy where fruit resources were abundant, whereas partial and opportunistic frugivores were more common on mid- and understory plants, respectively. We conclude that the vertical stratification of the frugivore community into obligate and opportunistic feeding guilds structures this plant-frugivore network. The canopy stratum comprises stronger links and generalized associations, whereas the lower strata are composed of weaker links and more specialized interactions. Our results suggest that seed-dispersal relationships of plants in lower forest strata are more prone to disruption than those of canopy trees.},

Networks of mutualistic relationship between distinct groups of species in ecological communities exhibit such nestedness, which is known to support the network's robustness. Despite such importance, the quantitative characteristics of nestedness are little understood. Here, we take a graph-theoretic approach to derive the scaling properties of nestedness in various model networks. Our results show how the heterogeneous connectivity patterns enhance nestedness. Also, we find that the nestedness of bipar- tite networks depends sensitively on the fraction of different types of nodes, causing nestedness to scale differently for nodes of different types.},

We investigate how several extinction orders affect the minimum number of secondary extinctions expected within pelagic food webs from 34 temperate freshwater lakes. An ecologically plausible extinction order is derived from the geographically nested pattern of species composition among the lakes and is corroborated by species' pH tolerances. Simulations suggest that lake communities are remarkably robust to this realistic extinction order and highly sensitive to the reverse sequence of species loss. This sensitivity is not well explained by the known sensitivity of networks to the loss of highly connected species but appears to be better explained by our observation that trophic specialists preferentially consume widely distributed species at low risk of extinction. Our results highlight an important aspect of community organization that may help to maintain biodiversity amidst changing environments.},

Species abundance patterns have been hypothesized to determine observed topological patterns. We evaluate this hypothesis in the context of host-parasite interaction networks.2. We used two independent series of data sets, one consisting of data for seven sites describing interactions between freshwater fish and their metazoan parasites and another consisting of data for 25 localities describing interactions between fleas and their mammalian hosts. We evaluated the influence of species abundance patterns on the distribution of specialization in these host-parasite interaction networks with the aid of null models.3. In parallel with recent studies of plant-animal mutualistic networks, our analyses suggest that host-parasite interactions in these systems are highly asymmetric: specialist parasites tend to interact with hosts with high parasite richness, whereas hosts with low parasite richness tend to interact mainly with generalist parasites.4. The observed distribution of specialization was predicted by a null model that assumed that species-specific probabilities of being assigned a link during the randomization process were roughly proportional to their relative abundance. Thus, abundant hosts tend to harbour richer parasite faunas, with a high proportion of rare specialists.},

Disturbance is usually believed to affect specialists negatively, while generalists are believed to benefit from disturbance; we call this the "specialization-disturbance" hypothesis. We also propose an associated hypothesis (the "specialization-asymmetry-disturbance" hypothesis) under which both specialization and asymmetry of interactions would explain species' responses to disturbance. We test these hypotheses using data from a plant-pollinator system that has been grazed by cattle (i.e., a biological disturbance) in southern Argentina. We quantified specialization in species interactions, specialization of interaction partners, and species' responses to disturbance. We found no relationship between degree of specialization and a species' response to disturbance. We also found that plant-pollinator interactions tend to be asymmetric in this system; there was no relationship between the degree of specialization of a given species and the degree of specialization of its interaction partners. However, asymmetry of interactions did not explain the variability in species' responses to disturbance. Thus, both hypotheses are rejected by our data. Possible reasons include failure to assess crucial resources, substantial direct effects of disturbance, inaccurate measures of specialization, difficulty detecting highly nonlinear relationships, and limitations of a nonexperimental approach. Or, in fact, there may be no relationship between specialization and response to disturbance.},

We tested whether trophic levels were apparent in 58 real food webs in four habitat types by examining patterns of trophic position. A large proportion of taxa (64.4{\%}) occupied integer trophic positions, suggesting that discrete trophic levels do exist. Importantly however, the majority of those trophic positions were aggregated around integer values of 0 and 1, representing plants and herbivores. For the majority of the real food webs considered here, secondary consumers were no more likely to occupy an integer trophic position than in randomized food webs. This means that, above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores. Omnivory was most common in marine systems, rarest in streams, and intermediate in lakes and terrestrial food webs. Trophic-level-based concepts such as trophic cascades may apply to systems with short food chains, but they become less valid as food chains lengthen.},

We aimed to assess the degree to which food webs display patch-scale variation, and the consequences for emergent properties at the larger scale of the stream reach. Spatial heterogeneity in ecological conditions (habitat structure and food resources) and food-web structure were measured in three streams. All food webs were constructed using equivalent effort at a patch scale (0.06 m(2)) and a reach scale (30-m stream length). A mosaic of habitat structure and food resources was reflected in considerable variability in food-web structure among patches, but there was less variation within than among streams. The variability in food-web attributes among patches could not always be related to ecological conditions, but food resource availability affected connectedness of food webs and trophic structure (measured as functional feeding groups). Of particular note was the result that reach-summary food webs were consistently different from patch-specific food webs in each stream. Reach-scale food webs underestimated connectance but overestimated prey: predator ratios and the number of trophic links. Summary webs sometimes placed species together that, in fact, did not coexist in the field. Such within-site food-web heterogeneity needs to be taken into account in future multiple-site comparisons of food-web structure.},

Such interactions may be particularly important in systems where habitat and trophic structure covary. I use the aquatic insects in bromeliads to examine the combined effects of trophic structure and habitat structure on a key ecosystem function: detrital processing. In Costa Rican bromeliads, trophic structure naturally covaries with both habitat complexity and habitat size, precluding any observational analysis of interactions between factors. I therefore designed mesocosms that allowed each factor to be manipulated separately. Increases in mesocosm complexity reduced predator (damselfly larva) efficiency, resulting in high detritivore abundances, indirectly increasing detrital processing rates. However, increased complexity also directly reduced the per capita foraging efficiency of the detritivores. Over short time periods, these trends effectively cancelled each other out in terms of detrital processing. Over longer time periods, more complex patterns emerged. Increases in mesocosm size also reduced both predator efficiency and detritivore efficiency, leading to no net effect on detrital processing. In many systems, ecosystem functions may be impacted by strong interactions between trophic structure and habitat structure, cautioning against examining either effect in isolation.},

abstract = {Geographical gradients in the stability of cyclic populations of herbivores and their predators may relate to the degree of specialization of predators. However, such changes are usually associated with transition from specialist to generalist predator species, rather than from geographical variation in dietary breadth of specialist predators. Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations undergo cyclic fluctuations in northern parts of their range, but cycles are either greatly attenuated or lost altogether in the southern boreal forest where prey diversity is higher. We tested the influence of prey specialization on population cycles by measuring the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in lynx and their prey, estimating the contribution of hares to lynx diet across their range, and correlating this degree of specialization to the strength of their population cycles. Hares dominated the lynx diet across their range, but specialization on hares decreased in southern and western populations. The degree of specialization correlated with cyclic signal strength indicated by spectral analysis of lynx harvest data, but overall variability of lynx harvest (the standard deviation of natural-log-transformed harvest numbers) did not change significantly with dietary specialization. Thus, as alternative prey became more important in the lynx diet, the fluctuations became decoupled from a regular cycle but did not become less variable. Our results support the hypothesis that alternative prey decrease population cycle regularity but emphasize that such changes may be driven by dietary shifts among dominant specialist predators rather than exclusively through changes in the predator community.},

abstract = {The increase in species richness from the poles to the Equator has been observed in numerous terrestrial and aquatic taxa. A number of different hypotheses have been put forward as explanations for this trend, e.g. area and energy availability. However, whether these hypotheses apply to large spatial scales in marine environments remains unclear. The present study shows a clear latitudinal gradient from high to low latitude (from 80 degrees N to 70 degrees S) in marine species richness for 6643 species (fishes and invertebrates) in 10 different taxa dwelling in benthic and pelagic habitats on both sides of the Atlantic. The patterns in benthic taxa are strongly influenced by coastal hydrographic processes, with marked peaks and troughs, and consequently the gradients are not symmetric along both Atlantic sides. Pelagic taxa show a plateau-shaped distribution and the influence from coastal events on gradients could not be demonstrated. The relationships between species richness and different environmental factors indicate that area size does not explain the latitudinal pattern in benthic species richness on a large spatial scale. Sea-surface temperature (positive relationship) is the best predictor of this pattern for benthic species, and nitrate concentration (negative relationship) is the best predictor for pelagic species. The results call into question the existence of a single primary cause that would explain the pattern in marine species richness on a large spatial scale.},

abstract = {Explaining the structure of terrestrial and aquatic food webs remains one of the most important challenges of ecological theory. Most existing models use emergent properties of food webs, such as diversity and connectance as parameters, to determine other food-web descriptors. Lower-level processes, in particular adaptation (whether by behavioral, developmental, or evolutionary mechanisms), are usually not considered. Here, we show that complex, realistic food webs may emerge by evolution from a single ancestor based on very simple ecological and evolutionary rules. In our model, adaptation acts on body size, whose impact on the metabolism and interactions of organisms is well established. Based on parameters defined at the organism scale, the model predicts emergent properties at the food-web scale. Variations of two key parameters (width of consumption niche and competition intensity) allow very different food-web structures and functionings to emerge, which are similar to those observed in some of the best-documented food webs.},

abstract = {No definitive explanation for the form of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem productivity exists nor is there agreement on the mechanisms linking diversity and productivity across scales. Here, we examine changes in the form of the diversity-productivity relationship within and across the plant communities at three observational scales: plots, alliances, and physiognomic vegetation types (PVTs). Vascular plant richness data are from 4,760 20 m2 vegetation field plots. Productivity estimates in grams carbon per square meter are from annual net primary productivity (ANPP) models. Analyses with generalized linear models confirm scale dependence in the species diversity-productivity relationship. At the plot focus, the observed diversity-productivity relationship was weak. When plot data were aggregated to a focus of vegetation alliances, a hump-shaped relationship was observed. Species turnover among plots cannot explain the observed hump-shaped relationship at the alliance focus because we used mean plot richness across plots as our index of species richness for alliances and PVTs. The sorting of alliances along the productivity gradient appears to follow regional patterns of moisture availability, with alliances that occupy dry environments occurring within the increasing phase of the hump-shaped pattern, alliances that occupy mesic to hydric environments occurring near the top or in the decreasing phase of the curve, and alliances that occupy the wettest environments having the fewest species and the highest ANPP. This pattern is consistent with the intermediate productivity theory but appears to be inconsistent with the predictions of water-energy theory.},

abstract = {The decline of biodiversity with latitude has received great attention, but both the concise pattern and the causes of the gradient are under strong debate. Most studies of the latitudinal gradient comprise only one or few organism types and are often restricted to certain region or habitat types. To test for significant variation in the gradient between organisms, habitats, or regions, a meta-analysis was conducted on nearly 600 latitudinal gradients assembled from the literature. Each gradient was characterized by two effect sizes, strength (correlation coefficient) and slope, and additionally by 14 variables describing organisms, habitats, and regions. The analysis corroborated the high generality of the latitudinal diversity decline. Gradients on regional scales were significantly stronger and steeper than on local scales, and slopes also varied with sampling grain. Both strength and slope increased with organism body mass, and strength increased with trophic level. The body mass-effect size relation varied for ecto- versus homeotherm organisms and for different dispersal types, suggesting allometric effects on energy use and dispersal ability as possible mechanisms for the body mass effect. Latitudinal gradients were weaker and less steep in freshwater than in marine or terrestrial environments and differed significantly between continents and habitat types. The gradient parameters were not affected by hemisphere or the latitudinal range covered. This analysis is the first to describe these general and significant patterns, which have important consequences for models aiming to explain the latitudinal gradient.},

abstract = {Mutualistic networks involving plants and their pollinators or frugivores have been shown recently to exhibit a particular asymmetrical organization of interactions among species called nestedness: a core of reciprocal generalists accompanied by specialist species that interact almost exclusively with generalists. This structure contrasts with compartmentalized assemblage structures that have been verified in antagonistic food webs. Here we evaluated whether nestedness is a property of another type of mutualism-the interactions between ants and extrafloral nectary-bearing plants--and whether species richness may lead to differences in degree of nestedness among biological communities. We investigated network structure in four communities in Mexico. Nested patterns in ant-plant networks were very similar to those previously reported for pollination and frugivore systems, indicating that this form of asymmetry in specialization is a common feature of mutualisms between free-living species, but not always present in species-poor systems. Other ecological factors also appeared to contribute to the nested asymmetry in specialization, because some assemblages showed more extreme asymmetry than others even when species richness was held constant. Our results support a promising approach for the development of multispecies coevolutionary theory, leading to the idea that specialization may coevolve in different but simple ways in antagonistic and mutualistic assemblages.},

abstract = {Abstract Most community-based models in ecology assume that all individuals within a species respond similarly to environmental conditions and thereby exert identical effects as consumers or prey. Rather, individuals differ among systems, with important implications for population demographics and community interactions. For widely distributed assemblages made up of poikilotherms with high first-year mortality, species-specific differences in growth reaction norms as affected by both temperature and genotype will influence biotic interactions. For a broadly distributed fish assemblage, first-year growth does not vary with latitude for a planktivorous prey species, but declines with increasing latitude for a terminal piscivore. Size-based competitive interactions between these species are likely to be more intense at high latitudes, as they spend an extended time sharing resources during early life. Such patterns probably are pervasive and must be considered when seeking to understand species interactions. Improving our knowledge of how temperature and local adaptations affect size-based interactions should enhance our ability to manage and conserve widespread assemblages.},

abstract = {Empirical studies have shown that, in real ecosystems, species-interaction strengths are generally skewed in their distribution towards weak interactions. Some theoretical work also suggests that weak interactions, especially in omnivorous links, are important for the local stability of a community at equilibrium. However, the majority of theoretical studies use uniform distributions of interaction strengths to generate artificial communities for study. We investigate the effects of the underlying interaction-strength distribution upon the return time, permanence and feasibility of simple Lotka-Volterra equilibrium communities. We show that a skew towards weak interactions promotes local and global stability only when omnivory is present. It is found that skewed interaction strengths are an emergent property of stable omnivorous communities, and that this skew towards weak interactions creates a dynamic constraint maintaining omnivory. Omnivory is more likely to occur when omnivorous interactions are skewed towards weak interactions. However, a skew towards weak interactions increases the return time to equilibrium, delays the recovery of ecosystems and hence decreases the stability of a community. When no skew is imposed, the set of stable omnivorous communities shows an emergent distribution of skewed interaction strengths. Our results apply to both local and global concepts of stability and are robust to the definition of a feasible community. These results are discussed in the light of empirical data and other theoretical studies, in conjunction with their broader implications for community assembly.},

abstract = {We compared the community-structure of reef-fish over different spatial scales, levels of exposure, and physical complexity in 12 study zones of Bocas del Toro, Panama. Two hundred and eightyeight visual censuses were conducted on 48 benthic transects from April to September 2002. Substrate coverage and surface complexity was also recorded. We found 128 fish species in 38 families with increasing species richness from sheltered to expose and from low-complexity to intermediate and high-complexity zones. Only 7{\%} of the species occurred in all zones. Gobies and pomacentrids were most abundant in sheltered areas and labrids at exposed zones. Eleven species showed significant size-segregations between zones, suggesting ontogenic movements, with smaller sizes in low-complexity zones, and larger-sizes in intermediate to high complexity areas. Species-richness and diversity are high in three of the four exposed zones and in the main areas of massive-coral reefs and significantly correlate with certain types of complex substrates. Highly mobile fish were more abundant in exposed rocky zones while sedentary fish were more abundant in sheltered massive and foliaceous corals zones. Towards the most exposed areas, the number of mobile invertebrate-feeding fish species greatly increased, while territorial herbivores increased in sheltered zones. Roving herbivores (scarids and acanthurids) showed lower frequency than territorial herbivores in all zones. Demersal zooplankton feeders were common in sheltered areas and oceanic planktivores in exposed areas. Omnivores were more abundant in zones of rubble and sand. Carnivores were less frequent, but contribute to the majority of species. We concluded that the species richness in Bocas del Toro relates to the structural complexity of the substrate rather than substrate type. While some species change their preferred habitat during ontogeny, general species diversity increased with habitat complexity. This increase was more pronounced in exposed zones. It seem that water current strength and waves, which select for swimming capacity, play an important but still little understood role in the organization of fish assemblages in rocky and coral reefs.},

abstract = {A major goal of ecology is to determine the causes of the latitudinal gradient in global distribution of species richness. Current evidence points to either energy availability or habitat heterogeneity as the most likely environmental drivers in terrestrial systems, but their relative importance is controversial in the absence of analyses of global (rather than continental or regional) extent. Here we use data on the global distribution of extant continental and continental island bird species to test the explanatory power of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity while simultaneously addressing issues of spatial resolution, spatial autocorrelation, geometric constraints upon species' range dynamics, and the impact of human populations and historical glacial ice-cover. At the finest resolution (18), topographical variability and temperature are identified as the most important global predictors of avian species richness in multi- predictor models. Topographical variability is most important in single-predictor models, followed by productive energy. Adjusting for null expectations based on geometric constraints on species richness improves overall model fit but has negligible impact on tests of environmental predictors. Conclusions concerning the relative importance of environmental predictors of species richness cannot be extrapolated from one biogeographic realm to others or the globe. Rather a global perspective confirms the primary importance of mountain ranges in high-energy areas. Keywords:},

abstract = {Aim We investigated patterns of species richness and composition of the aquatic food web found in the liquid-filled leaves of the North American purple pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea (Sarraceniaceae), from local to continental scales. Location We sampled 20 pitcher-plant communities at each of 39 sites spanning the geographic range of S. purpurea– from northern Florida to Newfoundland and westward to eastern British Columbia. Methods Environmental predictors of variation in species composition and species richness were measured at two different spatial scales: among pitchers within sites and among sites. Hierarchical Bayesian models were used to examine correlates and similarities of species richness and abundance within and among sites. Results Ninety-two taxa of arthropods, protozoa and bacteria were identified in the 780 pitcher samples. The variation in the species composition of this multi-trophic level community across the broad geographic range of the host plant was lower than the variation among pitchers within host-plant populations. Variation among food webs in richness and composition was related to climate, pore-water chemistry, pitcher-plant morphology and leaf age. Variation in the abundance of the five most common invertebrates was also strongly related to pitcher morphology and site-specific climatic and other environmental variables. Main conclusions The surprising result that these communities are more variable within their host-plant populations than across North America suggests that the food web in S. purpurea leaves consists of two groups of species: (1) a core group of mostly obligate pitcher-plant residents that have evolved strong requirements for the host plant and that co-occur consistently across North America, and (2) a larger set of relatively uncommon, generalist taxa that co-occur patchily.

abstract = {Food webs, the networks of feeding links between species, are central to our understanding of ecosystem structure, stability, and function. One of the key aspects of food web structure is complexity, or connectance, the number of links expressed as a proportion of the total possible number of links. Connectance (complexity) is linked to the stability of webs and is a key parameter in recent models of other aspects of web structure. However, there is still no fundamental biological explanation for connectance in food webs. Here, we propose that constraints on diet breadth, driven by optimal foraging, provide such an explanation. We show that a simple diet breadth model predicts highly constrained values of connectance as an emergent consequence of individual foraging behavior. When combined with features of real food web data, such as taxonomic and trophic aggregation and cumulative sampling of diets, the model predicts well the levels of connectance and scaling of connectance with species richness, seen in real food webs. This result is a previously undescribed synthesis of foraging theory and food web theory, in which network properties emerge from the behavior of individuals and, as such, provides a mechanistic explanation of connectance currently lacking in food web models.},

abstract = {The relationship between mammal community structure and vertical variation in hab- itat physiognomy (complexity) and horizontal variation in habitat form (heterogeneity) was examined on five study areas in the llanos of Venezuela. Data on the small mammals ({\textless} 1 kg) of the study sites were obtained through a mark-recapture trapping program of {\textgreater}38 000 trap nights from 1976-1978. Data on the distribution of large, nonvolant mammals were obtained during 24 mo of field observation. Measures of habitat complexity and habitat heterogeneity were derived using principal components analysis. There was little association between habitat structure and the richness, diversity, abundance, and biomass of small mammals. Abiotic factors, such as the degree of wet-season flooding, probably play an important role in patterns of small mammal distribution and abundance. The total number of mammal species was positively correlated with habitat complexity but not correlated with habitat heterogeneity. Increasing species richness across the complexity gradient was probably accommo- dated by increasing potential food resources. New species were added to complex communities primarily through guild expansion rather than guild addition.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated a negative relationship between increasing habitat complexity and predator foraging success. Results from many of these studies suggest a non-linear relationship, and it has been hypothesised that some "threshold level" of complexity is required before foraging success is reduced significantly. We examined this hypothesis using largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) foraging on juvenile bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) in various densities of artificial vegetation. Largemouth foraging success differed significantly among the densities of vegetation tested. Regression analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between increasing plant stem density and predator foraging success. Logistic analysis demonstrated a significant fit of our data to a logistic model, from which was calculated the threshold level of plant stem density necessary to reduce predator foraging success. Studies with various prey species have shown selection by prey for more complex habitats as a refuge from predation. In this study, we also examined the effects of increasing habitat complexity (i.e. plant stem density) on choice of habitat by juvenile bluegills while avoiding predation. Plant stem density significantly effected choice of habitat as a refuge. The relationship between increasing habitat complexity and prey choice of habitat was found to be positive and non-linear. As with predator foraging success, logistic analysis demonstrated a significant fit of our data to a logistic model. Using this model we calculated the "threshold" level of habitat complexity required before prey select a habitat as a refuge. This density of vegetation proved to be considerably higher than that necessary to significantly reduce predator foraging success, indicating that bluegill select habitats safe from predation. Implications of these results and various factors which may affect the relationships described are discussed.},

abstract = {Fleshy-fruited plants in tropical forests largely rely on vertebrate frugivores to disperse their seeds. Although this plant-animal interaction is typically considered a diffuse mutualism, it is fundamental as it provides the template on which tropical forest communities are structured. We applied a mutualistic network approach to investigate the relationship between small-fruited fleshy plant species and the fruit-eating bird community in an intact evergreen forest in northeast Thailand. A minimum of 53 bird species consumed fruits of 136 plant species. Plant-avian frugivore networks were highly asymmetrical, with observed networks filling 30{\%} of all potential links. Whereas some of the missing links in the present study might be due to undersampling, forbidden links can be attributed to size constraints, accessibility and phenological uncoupling, and although the majority of missing links were unknown (58.2{\%}), many were probably due to a given bird species being either rare or only a very occasional fruit eater. The most common frugivores were bulbuls, barbets and fairy-bluebirds, which were responsible for the majority of fruit removal from small fleshy fruited species in our system. Migratory birds seemed to be a minor component of the plant-frugivore networks, accounting for only 3{\%} of feeding visits to fruiting trees; they filled 2{\%} of the overall potential networks. The majority of interactions were generalized unspecific; however, Saurauia roxburghii Wall. appeared to be dependent on flowerpeckers for dispersal, while Thick-billed Pigeons were only seen to eat figs.},

abstract = {In networks of plant-animal mutualisms, different animal groups interact preferentially with different plants, thus forming distinct modules responsible for different parts of the service. However, what we currently know about seed dispersal networks is based only on birds. Therefore, we wished to fill this gap by studying bat-fruit networks and testing how they differ from bird-fruit networks. As dietary overlap of Neotropical bats and birds is low, they should form distinct mutualistic modules within local networks. Furthermore, since frugivory evolved only once among Neotropical bats, but several times independently among Neotropical birds, greater dietary overlap is expected among bats, and thus connectance and nestedness should be higher in bat-fruit networks. If bat-fruit networks have higher nestedness and connectance, they should be more robust to extinctions. We analyzed 1 mixed network of both bats and birds and 20 networks that consisted exclusively of either bats (11) or birds (9). As expected, the structure of the mixed network was both modular (M = 0.45) and nested (NODF = 0.31); one module contained only birds and two only bats. In 20 datasets with only one disperser group, bat-fruit networks (NODF = 0.53 ± 0.09, C = 0.30 ± 0.11) were more nested and had a higher connectance than bird-fruit networks (NODF = 0.42 ± 0.07, C = 0.22 ± 0.09). Unexpectedly, robustness to extinction of animal species was higher in bird-fruit networks (R = 0.60 ± 0.13) than in bat-fruit networks (R = 0.54 ± 0.09), and differences were explained mainly by species richness. These findings suggest that a modular structure also occurs in seed dispersal networks, similar to pollination networks. The higher nestedness and connectance observed in bat-fruit networks compared with bird-fruit networks may be explained by the monophyletic evolution of frugivory in Neotropical bats, among which the diets of specialists seem to have evolved from the pool of fruits consumed by generalists.},

abstract = {Trophic structure, the partitioning of biomass among trophic levels, is a major characteristic of ecosystems. Most studies of the forces that shape trophic struc-ture emphasize either " bottom-up " or " top-down " regulation of populations and communities. Recent work has shown that these two forces are not mutually exclusive alternatives, but efforts to model their interaction still often yield unre-alistic predictions. We focus on the problems involved with modeling situations in which community composition, including both the number of trophic levels and the species composition within a trophic level, can change. We review the devel-opment of these ideas, emphasizing in particular how compositional change can alter theoretical expectations about the regulation of trophic structure. A compar-ison of studies on the effects of predators and resource productivity in limnetic ecosystems reveals an intriguing disparity between the results of manipulative experiments and those of correlational studies. We suggest that this contrast is a result of the difference in the temporal scales operating in the two types of studies. Ecosystem-level variables may appear to approach an equilibrium in short-term press experiments; however, processes such as invasion and extinction of species will not have time to play out in most such experiments. We found that the responses of ecosystems to short-term experimental treatments involve less change in species composition than is found in natural communities that have diverged in response to local conditions over longer periods. We argue that the results of short-term experiments support the predictions of models in which},

In this paper, we analyse the similarities and differences between ecological succession and evolutionary recovery to provide a preliminary ecological theory of recoveries. A simple evolutionary model with three trophic levels is presented, and its properties (closely resembling those observed in the fossil record) are compared with characteristic patterns of ecological response to disturbances in continuous models of three-level ecosystems.},

@article{Duffy2010,
abstract = {Proposed links between biodiversity and ecosystem processes have generated intense interest and controversy in recent years. With few exceptions, however, empirical studies have focused on grassland plants and laboratory aquatic microbial systems, whereas there has been little attention to how changing animal diversity may influence ecosystem processes. Meanwhile, a separate research tradition has demonstrated strong top-down forcing in many systems, but has considered the role of diversity in these processes only tangentially. Integration of these research directions is necessary for more complete understanding in both areas. Several considerations suggest that changing diversity in multi-level food webs can have important ecosystem effects that can be qualitatively different than those mediated by plants. First, extinctions tend to be biased by trophic level: higher-level consumers are less diverse, less abundant, and under stronger anthropogenic pressure on average than wild plants, and thus face greater risk of extinction. Second, unlike plants, consumers often have impacts on ecosystems disproportionate to their abundance. Thus, an early consequence of declining diversity will often be skewed trophic structure, potentially reducing top-down influence. Third, where predators remain abundant, declining diversity at lower trophic levels may change effectiveness of predation and penetrance of trophic cascades by reducing trait diversity and the potential for compensation among species within a level. The mostly indirect evidence available provides some support for this prediction. Yet effects of changing animal diversity on functional processes have rarely been tested experimentally. Evaluating impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem function requires expanding the scope of current experimental research to multi-level food webs. A central challenge to doing so, and to evaluating the importance of trophic cascades specifically, is understanding the distribution of interaction strengths within natural communities and how they change with community composition. Although topology of most real food webs is extremely complex, it is not at all clear how much of this complexity translates to strong dynamic linkages that influence aggregate biomass and community composition. Finally, there is a need for more detailed data on patterns of species loss from real ecosystems (community “disassembly” rules).},

abstract = {Questions: Are interaction patterns in species interaction networks different from what one expects by chance alone? In particular, are these networks nested - a pattern where resources taken by more specialized consumers form a proper subset of those taken by more generalized consumers? Organisms: Fifty-nine and 42 networks of mutualistic and host-parasitoid interactions, respectively. Analytical methods: For each network, the observed degree of nestedness is compared with the distribution of nestedness values derived from a collection of 1000 random networks. Those networks with nestedness values lower than 95{\%} of all random values are considered 'unusually nested'. The analysis considers two different metrics of nestedness and five different network randomization algorithms, each of which differs in the ecological assumptions imposed. Results: Most ecological networks are unusually nested when compared with loosely constrained random networks. Comparisons with highly constrained networks temper these findings, but we still report a significant preponderance of nested networks (typically those with the most species). Conclusions: Bascompte et al. (2003) previously showed most observed mutualistic networks to be unusually nested. Later work using more ecologically realistic randomization algorithms cast doubt on those results. Across the largest set of species interactions considered to date, we conclude that an unexpectedly large number of interaction networks are patterned in a non-random manner. ¬{\textcopyright} 2010 Stuart L.

abstract = {ecent reviews of plant-pollinator mutualistic networks showed that gen- eralization is a common pattern in this type of interaction. Here we examine the ecological correlates of generalization patterns in plant-pollinator networks, especially how interaction patterns covary with latitude, elevation, and insularity. We review the few published anal- yses of whole networks and include unpublished material, analyzing 29 complete plant- pollinator networks that encompass arctic, alpine, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtrop- ical-tropical areas. The number of interactions observed (I) was a linear function of network size (M) the maximum number of interactions: lnI = 0.575 + 0.61 lnM; R2 = 0.946. The connectance (C), the fraction of observed interactions relative to the total possible, decreased exponentially with species richness, the sum of animal and plant species in each community (A + P): C = 13.83 exp[-0.003(A + P)]. After controlling for species richness, the residual connectance was significantly lower in highland ({\textgreater}1500 m elevation) than in lowland networks and differed marginally among biogeographic regions, with both alpine and trop- ical networks showing a trend for lower residual connectance. The two Mediterranean networks showed the highest residual connectance. After correcting for variation in network size, plant species were shown to be more generalized at higher latitude and lowland habitats, but showed increased specialization on islands. Oceanic island networks showed an im- poverishment of potential animal pollinators (lower ratio of animal to plant species, A: P. compared to mainland networks) associated with this trend of increased specialization. Plants, but not their flower-visiting animals, supported the often-repeated statements about higher specificity in the tropics than at higher latitudes. The pattern of interaction build- up as diversity increases in pollination networks does not differ appreciably from other mutualisms, such as plant-seed disperser networks or more complex food webs.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the structure of ecological networks is a crucial task for interpreting community and ecosystem responses to global change. 2. Despite the recent interest in this subject, almost all studies have focused exclusively on one specific network property. The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3. Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant-animal mutualistic and host-parasite networks. 4. We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5. The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6. A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities.},

abstract = {1. Much of the current understanding of ecological systems is based on theory that does not explicitly take into account individual variation within natural populations. However, individuals may show substantial variation in resource use. This variation in turn may be translated into topological properties of networks that depict interactions among individuals and the food resources they consume (individual-resource networks). 2. Different models derived from optimal diet theory (ODT) predict highly distinct patterns of trophic interactions at the individual level that should translate into distinct network topologies. As a consequence, individual-resource networks can be useful tools in revealing the incidence of different patterns of resource use by individuals and suggesting their mechanistic basis. 3. In the present study, using data from several dietary studies, we assembled individual-resource networks of 10 vertebrate species, previously reported to show interindividual diet variation, and used a network-based approach to investigate their structure. 4. We found significant nestedness, but no modularity, in all empirical networks, indicating that (i) these populations are composed of both opportunistic and selective individuals and (ii) the diets of the latter are ordered as predictable subsets of the diets of the more opportunistic individuals. 5. Nested patterns are a common feature of species networks, and our results extend its generality to trophic interactions at the individual level. This pattern is consistent with a recently proposed ODT model, in which individuals show similar rank preferences but differ in their acceptance rate for alternative resources. Our findings therefore suggest a common mechanism underlying interindividual variation in resource use in disparate taxa.},

abstract = {Mutualistic interactions involving pollination and ant-plant mutualistic networks typically feature tightly linked species grouped in modules. However, such modularity is infrequent in seed dispersal networks, presumably because research on those networks predominantly includes a single taxonomic animal group (e.g. birds). Herein, for the first time, we examine the pattern of interaction in a network that includes multiple taxonomic groups of seed dispersers, and the mechanisms underlying modularity. We found that the network was nested and modular, with five distinguishable modules. Our examination of the mechanisms underlying such modularity showed that plant and animal trait values were associated with specific modules but phylogenetic effect was limited. Thus, the pattern of interaction in this network is only partially explained by shared evolutionary history. We conclude that the observed modularity emerged by a combination of phylogenetic history and trait convergence of phylogenetically unrelated species, shaped by interactions with particular types of dispersal agents.},

abstract = {A detailed and relatively evenly resolved food web of Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, was constructed to evaluate the sensitivity of food-web patterns to the level of detail (degree of resolution) in food-web data. This study presents definitions (e.g., ecosystem food webs) and methods for constructing and reducing the resolution of food webs to provide relatively pragmatic and rigorous touchstones for consistency in future food-web studies. This analysis suggests that food-web patterns such as the scale-invariant links-per-species ratio, short chain lengths, and limited number of trophic levels are constrained by the resolution of food-web data rather than by ecological factors. Patterns less sensitive to changes in resolution such as directed connectance (the proportion of observed directed links to all possible directed links) may be robust food-web attributes. The food web of Little Rock Lake appears to be the first highly and evenly resolved food web of a large natural ecosystem originally documented for the purpose of examining quantitative food-web patterns. This ecosystem food web contains roughly twice as many species as the largest web to date. It also may provide the most credible portrait available of the detailed trophic structure of a whole ecosystem. The 93-trophic-species web of Little Rock Lake differs from previously published trophic-species webs by having more links per species (L/S = 11), longer chain lengths (average: greater-than-or-equal-to 10, maximum: greater-than-to-equal-to 16), species at higher trophic levels (maximum: = 12), higher fractions of intermediate species, and smaller fractions of top species and links to top species. The sensitivity of quantitative food-web patterns to changes in resolution was examined in several series of trophically aggregated Little Rock Lake webs. Each of the series starts with a highly and relatively evenly resolved web with 182 consumer, producer, and decomposer taxa and ends with low-resolution webs with 9 aggregates of taxa. Taxa were aggregated based on the proportion of predators and prey shared by the taxa. Different series of webs were generated using different criteria for linking aggregates to evaluate the sensitivity of food-web patterns to linkage criteria. The sensitivity analysis revealed that several, but not all, quantitative food-web patterns are very sensitive to systematic aggregation of the web. Sensitive patterns include number of links per species, linkage complexity, the distributions of chain lengths and species among trophic levels, and the proportions of top species and links to top species. Less-sensitive patterns include connectance, the ratio of predators to prey, the proportions of intermediate and basal species, and the proportions of links that are between intermediate and basal species. Directed connectance is the only pattern examined that is both very robust to trophic aggregation and generally comparable to other community webs. Quantitative food-web patterns in published community webs are generally similar to highly aggregated Little Rock Lake webs (versions with 9-40 aggregates). These findings suggest that previously described community food webs are severely aggregated versions of more elaborate webs similar to that of Little Rock Lake.},

abstract = {The structure of ecological interaction networks is often interpreted as a product of meaningful ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape the degree of specialization in community associations. However, here we show that both unweighted network metrics (connectance, nestedness, and degree distribution) and weighted network metrics (interaction evenness, interaction strength asymmetry) are strongly constrained and biased by the number of observations. Rarely observed species are inevitably regarded as "specialists," irrespective of their actual associations, leading to biased estimates of specialization. Consequently, a skewed distribution of species observation records (such as the lognormal), combined with a relatively low sampling density typical for ecological data, already generates a "nested" and poorly "connected" network with "asymmetric interaction strengths" when interactions are neutral. This is confirmed by null model simulations of bipartite networks, assuming that partners associate randomly in the absence of any specialization and any variation in the correspondence of biological traits between associated species (trait matching). Variation in the skewness of the frequency distribution fundamentally changes the outcome of network metrics. Therefore, interpretation of network metrics in terms of fundamental specialization and trait matching requires an appropriate control for such severe constraints imposed by information deficits. When using an alternative approach that controls for these effects, most natural networks of mutualistic or antagonistic systems show a significantly higher degree of reciprocal specialization (exclusiveness) than expected under neutral conditions. A higher exclusiveness is coherent with a tighter coevolution and suggests a lower ecological redundancy than implied by nested networks.},

abstract = {Nested structure, in which specialists interact with subsets of species with which generalists interact, has been repeatedly found in networks of mutualistic interactions and thus is considered a general feature of mutualistic communities. However, it is uncertain how exclusive nested structure is for mutualistic communities since few studies have evaluated nestedness in other types of networks. Here, we show that 31 published food webs consist of bipartite subwebs that are as highly nested as mutualistic networks, contradicting the hypothesis that antagonistic interactions disfavor nested structure. Our findings suggest that nested networks may be a common pattern of communities that include resource-consumer interactions. In contrast to the hypothesis that nested structure enhances biodiversity in mutualistic communities, we also suggest that nested food webs increase niche overlap among consumers and thus prevent their coexistence. We discuss potential mechanisms for the emergence of nested structure in food webs and other types of ecological networks.},

abstract = {Few models concern how environmental variables such as temperature affect community structure. Here, we develop a model of how temperature affects food web connectance, a powerful driver of population dynamics and community structure. We use the Arrhenius equation to add temperature dependence of foraging traits to an existing model of food web structure. The model predicts potentially large temperature effects on connectance. Temperature-sensitive food webs exhibit slopes of up to 0.01 units of connectance per 1 degrees C change in temperature. This corresponds to changes in diet breadth of one resource item per 2 degrees C (assuming a food web containing 50 species). Less sensitive food webs exhibit slopes down to 0.0005, which corresponds to about one resource item per 40 degrees C. Relative sizes of the activation energies of attack rate and handling time determine whether warming increases or decreases connectance. Differences in temperature sensitivity are explained by differences between empirical food webs in the body size distributions of organisms. We conclude that models of temperature effects on community structure and dynamics urgently require considerable development, and also more and better empirical data to parameterize and test them.},

abstract = {Aim  We surveyed the empirical literature to determine how well six diversity hypotheses account for spatial patterns in species richness across varying scales of grain and extent. Location  Worldwide. Methods  We identified 393 analyses (‘cases') in 297 publications meeting our criteria. These criteria included the requirement that more than one diversity hypothesis was tested for its relationship with species richness. We grouped variables representing the hypotheses into the following ‘correlate types': climate/productivity, environmental heterogeneity, edaphics/nutrients, area, biotic interactions and dispersal/history (colonization limitation or other historical or evolutionary effect). For each case we determined the ‘primary' variable: the one most strongly correlated with taxon richness. We defined ‘primacy' as the proportion of cases in which each correlate type was represented by the primary variable, relative to the number of times it was studied. We tested for differences in both primacy and mean coefficient of determination of the primary variable between the hypotheses and between categories of five grouping variables: grain, extent, taxon (animal vs. plant), habitat medium (land vs. water) and insularity (insular vs. connected). Results  Climate/productivity had the highest overall primacy, and environmental heterogeneity and dispersal/history had the lowest. Primacy of climate/productivity was much higher in large-grain and large-extent studies than at smaller scales. It was also higher on land than in water, and much higher in connected systems than in insular ones. For other hypotheses, differences were less pronounced. Throughout, studies on plants and animals showed similar patterns. Coefficients of determination of the primary variables differed little between hypotheses and across the grouping variables, the strongest effects being low means in the smallest grain class and for edaphics/nutrients variables, and a higher mean for water than for land in connected systems but vice versa in insular systems. We highlight areas of data deficiency. Main conclusions  Our results support the notion that climate and productivity play an important role in determining species richness at large scales, particularly for non-insular, terrestrial habitats. At smaller extents and grain sizes, the primacy of the different types of correlates appears to differ little from null expectation. In our analysis, dispersal/history is rarely the best correlate of species richness, but this may reflect the difficulty of incorporating historical factors into regression models, and the collinearity between past and current climates. Our findings are consistent with the view that climate determines the capacity for species richness. However, its influence is less evident at smaller spatial scales, probably because (1) studies small in extent tend to sample little climatic range, and (2) at large grains some other influences on richness tend to vary mainly within the sampling unit.},

abstract = {Knowing how an increase in the resource base of a food web produces effects that propagate through the web is central to developing a clearer understanding of food- web structure and dynamics. In a detritus-based terrestrial food web, we measured the responses of predaceous arthropods to increases in prey arthropods that occurred in response to experimentally enhancing the web's resource base. Open 2 X 5 m plots on the floor of a deciduous forest were randomly assigned to either a Food Enhancement or Control treat- ment. We supplemented the resource base of the arthropod community of the leaf litter layer for 3.5 mo by periodically adding chopped mushrooms, potatoes, and instant fruit fly medium to the Food Enhancement plots. Major taxa of detritivores and fungivores increased in response to added food. Densities of springtails (Collembola) were on average 3 X higher in the Food Enhancement than Control plots. Numbers of adult fungus gnats (Diptera: Sciaridae and Mycetophilidae) did not differ significantly between treatments after 6 wk but were {\textgreater}2X higher in Food Enhancement plots at the end of the experiment. Total Diptera were twice as abundant in Food Enhancement plots on both census dates. Arthropod groups that include a range of feeding strategies also increased. Mites (Ac- arina), which include detritivores, fungivores, and predators, were twice as abundant in the experimental treatment. Staphylinid and carabid beetles (Coleoptera), which are primarily predaceous but include omnivorous species, were several times more numerous in the Food Enhancement plots. Effects of increasing the resource base propagated through the food web, leading to higher densities of the major strictly predaceous arthropod taxa. Centipedes (Chilopoda), pseudoscorpions (Pseudoscorpionida), and spiders (Araneae) were -2X as abundant in the Food Enhancement treatment. Thus, our experiment uncovered substantial bottom-up lim- itation in this detritus-based food web, expressed as responses by predaceous arthropods at least two trophic links removed from the experimentally elevated resource.

abstract = {Historically, ecologists have been more inter- ested in organisms feeding at the tops of food chains than in organisms feeding at or near the bottom. The problem of taxonomic and trophic inconsistency within and among described food webs is central to criticisms of contemporary food web research. To study the e.ects of taxonomic and trophic aggregation on food web properties, 38 published food webs, each containing a large fraction of investigator-de{\textcopyright}ned biological species, were systematically aggregated by taxonomy and trophic (functional) group similarity. During each step of taxo- nomic and trophic aggregation, eight food web proper- ties (MIN, MAX, mean chain lengths; the fractions of basal, intermediate and top species; the ratio of all links by the total number of species, L/S; and rigid circuits) were calculated and their departures from the original, unaggregated version were recorded. We found only two properties showing wide systematic departure from initial values after both taxonomic and trophic group aggregation: the fraction of basal species and L/S. One reason for the relative `constancy' of the six other properties was due in part to large numbers of trophi- cally equivalent species (species with identical sets of prey and predators) found in these and other published webs. In the 38 webs, the average number of trophically equivalent species was 45{\%} and ranged from a low of 13{\%} in aquatic webs to a high of 71{\%} in certain ter- restrial systems (i.e., carrion webs). Six of the eight properties (MIN, MAX and mean chain lengths, the fractions of top and basal species, and the L/S ratio) were found to be more sensitive to taxonomic than to trophic aggregation. The relatively smaller variations observed in trophically lumped versions suggest that food web properties more aptly re{\^{i}}ect functional, rather than taxonomic, attributes of real food webs. These {\textcopyright}ndings parallel earlier trophic-based results, and bolster the conclusion that uneven lumping of taxonomic and trophic groups in published food web reports do not modify markedly the scaling behaviour of most of their descriptive properties.},

We tested whether temperature and precipitation contribute to temporal variation in the nestedness of mutualistic ant-plant networks. While maintaining their nested structure, nestedness increased with mean monthly precipitation and, particularly, with monthly temperature. Moreover, some species changed their role in network structure, shifting from peripheral to core species within the nested network. We could summarize that abiotic factors affect plant species in the vegetation (e.g., phenology), meaning presence/absence of food sources, consequently an increase/decrease of associations with ants, and finally, these variations to fluctuations in nestedness. While biotic factors are certainly important, greater attention needs to be given to abiotic factors as underlying determinants of the structures of ecological networks.},

Other statistics, such as the percentage of omnivory (62{\%}), percentage of cannibalistic species (31{\%}), num- ber of cycles (5{\%}), and the total number of links (L; 1562) and species (S; 81) are similar to more recent and extensively studied food webs. Finally, this food web exhibits a linkage density (L/S; 19.3), connectivity (C; 48.2{\%}), and Lyapunov stability proxy (S × C; 39.1) that are an order of magnitude higher than other webs or are disproportionate to the number of species observed in this system. Although the exact S and C relationship is contentious, the connectivity of food webs with more than 40 species is approximately 10{\%}, which is very different from the near 50{\%} observed for this ecosys- tem. The openness of marine ecosystems, lack of specialists, long lifespans, and large size changes across the life histories of many marine species can collectively make marine food webs more highly connected than their terrestrial and freshwater counterparts, contrary to food web theory. Changes in connectivity also have ramifications for ecosystem functioning and Lyapunov stability. The high con- nectivity of this food web and the mathematical determinants for stability are consistent with the weak nature of species interactions that have been observed and that are required for system persis- tence. Yet the historically high exploitation rates of marine organisms obfuscate our understanding of marine food web stability. It is possible that marine food webs are inherently very different from their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts, implying the need for modified paradigms of food web theory.},

abstract = {highest-quality empirical food webs to date, introducing a new topological property called the link distribution frequency (i.e. degree distribution), defined as the frequency of species  SL  with  L  links. Non-trivial differences are shown in link distribution frequencies between species-rich and species-poor communities, which might have important consequences for the responses of ecosystems to disturbances. Coarse-grained topological properties observed, as species richness-connectance and number of links-species richness relationships, provide no support for the theory of links-species scaling law or constant connectance across empirical food webs investigated. We further explore these observations by means of simulated food webs resulting from multitrophic assembly models using different functional responses between species. Species richness-connectance and links-species richness relationships of empirical food webs are reproduced by our models, but degree distributions are not properly predicted, suggesting the need of new theoretical approximations to food web assembly. The best agreement between empirical and simulated webs occurs for low values of interaction strength between species, corroborating previous empirical and theoretical findings where weak interactions govern food web dynamics.},

abstract = {Productivity, habitat heterogeneity and environmental similarity are of the most widely accepted hypotheses to explain spatial patterns of species richness and species composition similarity. Environmental factors may exhibit seasonal changes affecting species distributions. We explored possible changes in spatial patterns of bird species richness and species composition similarity. Feeding habits are likely to have a major influence in bird-environment associations and, given that food availability shows seasonal changes in temperate climates, we expect those associations to differ by trophic group (insectivores or granivores). We surveyed birds and estimated environmental variables along line-transects covering an E-W gradient of annual precipitation in the Pampas of Argentina during the autumn and the spring. We examined responses of bird species richness to spatial changes in habitat productivity and heterogeneity using regression analyses, and explored potential differences between seasons of those responses. Furthermore, we used Mantel tests to examine the relationship between species composition similarity and both the environmental similarity between sites and the geographic distance between sites, also assessing differences between seasons in those relationships. Richness of insectivorous birds was directly related to primary productivity in both seasons, whereas richness of seed-eaters showed a positive association with habitat heterogeneity during the spring. Species composition similarity between assemblages was correlated with both productivity similarity and geographic proximity during the autumn and the spring, except for insectivore assemblages. Diversity within main trophic groups seemed to reflect differences in their spatial patterns as a response to changes between seasons in the spatial patterns of food resources. Our findings suggest that considering different seasons and functional groups in the analyses of diversity spatial pattern could contribute to better understand the determinants of biological diversity in temperate climates. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

Three primary components explained 84{\%} of the variability in the data sets, suggesting substantial covariance among the properties employed in the literature. The first dimension explained 48{\%} of the variance and could be ascribed to connectance, covarying significantly with the proportion of intermediate species and characteristic path length. The second dimension explained 19{\%} and was related to trophic species richness. The third axis explained 17{\%} and was related to ecosystem net primary productivity. A distinct opposite clustering of connectance, the proportion of intermediate species, and mean trophic level vs. the proportion of top and basal species and path length suggests a dichotomy in food-web structure. Food webs appear either clustered and highly interconnected or elongated with fewer links.},

abstract = {Priority effects occur when established residents influence the colonization of individuals entering the community and thus provide insight into mechanisms underlying spatial differences and temporal changes in community composition. Using 20 spatially isolated patch reefs, I factorially manipulated the presence and absence of resident predators (groupers and dottybacks) and potential competitors (damselfishes) to determine whether and how they affect subsequent recruitment and mortality of newly settled fishes. During the 50-day experiment at Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, western Pacific), prior residency by predators dramatically reduced recruitment of damselfish, surgeonfish, butterflyfish, and rabbitfish and increased damselfish recruit mortality. In contrast, prior residency by potential competitors only reduced recruitment of damselfish and rabbitfish and did not affect recruit mortality. Effects of competitors were likely due to aggressive interactions between competitors and recruits that increased susceptibility of recruits to predators. Effects of residents were strongest within 48 hours of settlement, resulting in rapid establishment of patterns that persisted to the conclusion of the experiment. These results are similar to those from a comparable experiment in the Bahamas (western Atlantic), suggesting that priority effects may be a generally important cause of temporal and spatial variability in the composition of reef fish communities.},

It has previously been noted that empirical food webs are not strictly interval; however, upon comparison to suitable null hypotheses, we conclude that empirical food webs actually do exhibit a strong bias toward contiguity of prey, that is, toward intervality. Further, our results strongly suggest that empirically observed species and their diets can be mapped onto a single dimension. This finding validates a critical assumption in the recently proposed static niche model and provides guidance for ongoing efforts to develop dynamic models of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Ecologists have greatly advanced our understanding of the processes that regulate trophic structure and dynamics in ecosystems. However, the causes of systematic variation among ecosystems remain controversial and poorly elucidated. Contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in particular have inspired much speculation, but only recent empirical quantification. Here, we review evidence for systematic differences in energy flow and biomass partitioning between producers and herbivores, detritus and decomposers, and higher trophic levels. The magnitudes of different trophic pathways vary considerably, with less herbivory, more decomposers and more detrital accumulation on land. Aquatic-terrestrial differences are consistent across the global range of primary productivity, indicating that structural contrasts between the two systems are preserved despite large variation in energy input. We argue that variable selective forces drive differences in plant allocation patterns in aquatic and terrestrial environments that propagate upward to shape food webs. The small size and lack of structural tissues in phytoplankton mean that aquatic primary producers achieve faster growth rates and are more nutritious to heterotrophs than their terrestrial counterparts. Plankton food webs are also strongly size-structured, while size and trophic position are less strongly correlated in most terrestrial (and many benthic) habitats. The available data indicate that contrasts between aquatic and terrestrial food webs are driven primarily by the growth rate, size and nutritional quality of autotrophs. Differences in food-web architecture (food chain length, the prevalence of omnivory, specialization or anti-predator defences) may arise as a consequence of systematic variation in the character of the producer community.},

abstract = {Two phylogenetic comparative methods, independent contrasts and generalized least squares models, can be used to determine the statistical relationship between two or more traits. We show that the two approaches are functionally identical and that either can be used to make statistical inferences about values at internal nodes of a phylogenetic tree (hypothetical ancestors), to estimate relationships between characters, and to predict values for unmeasured species. Regression equations derived from independent contrasts can be placed back onto the original data space, including computation of both confidence intervals and prediction intervals for new observations. Predictions for unmeasured species (including extinct forms) can be made increasingly accurate and precise as the specificity of their placement on a phylogenetic tree increases, which can greatly increase statistical power to detect, for example, deviation of a single species from an allometric prediction. We reexamine published data for basal metabolic rates (BMR) of birds and show that conventional and phylogenetic allometric equations differ significantly. In new results, we show that, as compared with nonpasserines, passerines exhibit a lower rate of evolution in both body mass and mass-corrected BMR; passerines also have significantly smaller body masses than their sister clade. These differences may justify separate, clade-specific allometric equations for prediction of avian basal metabolic rates.},

It helps understand the species-area relationship, a fundamental pattern in ecology and an essential tool for conservation. The classic TIB does not, however, account for the complex structure of ecological systems. We extend the TIB to take into account trophic interactions and derive a species-specific model for occurrence probability. We find that the properties of the regional food web influence the species-area relationship, and that, in return, immigration and extinction dynamics affect local food web properties. We compare the accuracy of the classic TIB to our trophic TIB to predict community composition of real food webs and find strong support for our trophic extension of the TIB. Our approach provides a parsimonious explanation to species distributions and open new perspectives to integrate the complexity of ecological interactions into simple species distribution models.},

Recent research points to the importance of considering the distribution of body sizes of species when exploring the response of communities to such perturbations. Here, we present a new size-based approach for assessing the sensitivity and elasticity of community structure (species equilibrium abundances) and resilience (rate of return to equilibrium) to changes in the intrinsic growth rate of species and in the strengths of species interactions. We apply this approach on two natural systems, the pelagic communities of the Baltic Sea and Lake V{\"{a}}ttern, to illustrate how it can be used to identify potential keystone species and keystone links. We find that the keystone status of a species is closely linked to its body size. The analysis also suggests that communities are structurally and dynamically more sensitive to changes in the effects of prey on their consumers than in the effects of consumers on their prey. Moreover, we discuss how community sensitivity analysis can be used to study and compare the fragility of communities with different body size distributions by measuring the mean sensitivity or elasticity over all species or all interaction links in a community. We believe that the community sensitivity analysis developed here holds some promise for identifying species and links that are critical for the structural and dynamic robustness of ecological communities},

abstract = {Abstract The relationship between resident species diversity and invasion is generally negative in experimental studies but takes various forms in observational studies of natural communities. We hypothesized that stochastic species colonization, which applies to natural communities but not to experimental communities generally assembled through simultaneous species introduction, may lead to nonnegative diversity-invasion relationships via incurring priority effects. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated both resident species diversity and colonization history in sequentially assembled communities of bacterivorous protist species. We found that, despite a significant effect of assembly history on invader abundance, invader abundance decreased with diversity. This result was largely driven by positive selection effects associated with the dominant influence of an invasion-resistant species, which shared the most similar resource use pattern with the invader, and by the overall weak priority effects observed for the resident communities. Increasing species diversity, however, significantly strengthened priority effects, providing the first experimental support for the idea that larger species pools promote alternative community states. We suggest that elucidating mechanisms regulating the strength of priority effects may help in understanding variation in diversity-invasion relationships among natural communities.},

abstract = {Priority effects, in which the outcome of species interactions depends on the order of their arrival, are a key component of many models of community assembly. Yet, much remains unknown about how priority effects vary in strength among species in a community and what factors explain this variation. We experimented with a model natural community in laboratory microcosms that allowed us to quantify the strength of priority effects for most of the yeast species found in the floral nectar of a hummingbird-pollinated shrub at a biological preserve in northern California. We found that priority effects were widespread, with late-arriving species experiencing strong negative effects from early-arriving species. However, the magnitude of priority effects varied across species pairs. This variation was phylogenetically non-random, with priority effects stronger between closer relatives. Analysis of carbon and amino acid consumption profiles indicated that competition between closer relatives was more intense owing to higher ecological similarity, consistent with Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. These results suggest that phylogenetic relatedness between potential colonists may explain the strength of priority effects and, as a consequence, the degree to which community assembly is historically contingent.},

abstract = {Despite decades of research, it remains controversial whether ecological communities converge towards a common structure determined by environmental conditions irrespective of assembly history. Here, we show experimentally that the answer depends on the level of community organization considered. In a 9-year grassland experiment, we manipulated initial plant composition on abandoned arable land and subsequently allowed natural colonization. Initial compositional variation caused plant communities to remain divergent in species identities, even though these same communities converged strongly in species traits. This contrast between species divergence and trait convergence could not be explained by dispersal limitation or community neutrality alone. Our results show that the simultaneous operation of trait-based assembly rules and species-level priority effects drives community assembly, making it both deterministic and historically contingent, but at different levels of community organization.},

Those interactions are varied: they can be antagonistic ones involving predation, herbivory and parasitism, or mutualistic ones, such as those involving the pollination of flowers by insects. Moreover, the metaphor hints that the interactions may be complex to the point of being impossible to understand. All interactions can be visualized as ecological networks, in which species are linked together, either directly or indirectly through intermediate species. Ecological networks, although complex, have well defined patterns that both illuminate the ecological mechanisms underlying them and promise a better understanding of the relationship between complexity and ecological stability.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We report here the first evidence of faunistic equilibrium obtained through controlled, replicated experiments, together with an analysis of the immigration and extinction processes of animal species based on direct observations. The colonization of six small mangrove islands in Florida Bay by terrestrial arthropods was monitored at frequent intervals for 1 year after removal of the original fauna by methyl bromide fumigation. Both the observed data and climatic considerations imply that seasonality had little effect upon the basic shape of the colonization curves of species present vs. time. By 250 days after defaunation, the faunas of all the islands except the most distant one ("El") had regained species numbers and composition similar to those of untreated islands even though population densities were still abnormally low. Although early colonists included both weak and strong fliers, the former, particularly psocopterans, were usually the first to produce large populations. Among these same early invaders were the taxa displaying both the highest extinction rates and the greatest variability in species composition on the different islands. Ants, the ecological dominants of mangrove islands, were among the last to colonize, but they did so with the highest degree of predictability. The colonization curves plus static observations on untreated islands indicate strongly that a dynamic equilibrium number of species exists for any island. We believe the curves are produced by colonization involving little if any interaction, then a gradual decline as inter? action becomes important, and finally, a lasting dynamic equilibrium. Equations are given for the early immigration, extinction, and colonization curves. Dispersal to these islands is predominantly through aerial transport, both active and pas? sive. Extinction of the earliest colonists is probably caused chiefly by such physical factors as drowning or lack of suitable breeding sites and less commonly by competition and predation. !"-s population sizes increase it is expected that competition and predation will become more important. Observed turnover rates showed wide variance, with most values between 0.05 and 0.50 species/day. True turnover rates are probably much higher; with 0.67 species/day the extreme lower limit on any island. This very high value is at least roughly consistent with the turnover equation derived from the MacArthur-Wilson equilibrium model, which predicts turnover rates on the order of 0.1-1.0 species/day on the experimental islands.},

abstract = {Ecologists have found many patterns in food-web structure. Some, like the constant connectance hypothesis, lack definitive explanatory mechanisms. In response, we investigated whether community assembly mechanisms could explain why trophic complexity consistently scales with species richness among ecosystems. We analyzed how food-web structure developed during the community assembly recorded in Simberloff and Wilson's classic biogeography experiment. Using their arthropod surveys, we constructed six time series of food-webs from pre- and post-defaunation censuses of six experimental islands, and synthesized trophic information for 250 species from the literature and expert sources. We found that the fraction of specialist species increased and the fraction of generalists decreased during food-web assembly. Directed connectance initially declined over time, despite an increase in species richness, but eventually leveled off as predicted by the constant connectance hypothesis of diversity-complexity scaling. The initial decline was explained by later colonization by trophic specialists, probably due to limited resource availability during early colonization. Late- colonizing super-generalists maintained constant connectance at later dates. This relationship between colonization success and trophic breadth helps explain food-web patterns and corroborates assertions that community assembly is systematically influenced by species' trophic breadths.},

abstract = {1) For any taxon higher than genus, the expected mean number of species per genus (E(S/G)) for a randomly drawn subset is a non-decreasing function (approximately linear for many taxa) of the size of the subset, and is therefore lower than the mean number of species per genus for the entire taxon. 2) The relationship of actual S/G for an island biota to S/G expected for a random subset of identical size drawn from the species pool of the presumed source area is relatively insensitive to modifications of taxonomy and to use of a source area slightly larger than the real one. This relationship is subject to more drastic change upon use of incomplete species lists for island or source or a presumed source area smaller than or different from the real source. 3) Pseudo-random drawings of biotas of identical size to those of a number of islands show that, in general, the mean number of species per genus, though lower than in the source biota, is higher than would be expected on a hypothesis of random colonization. 4) The deviation of actual from expected S/G is not strongly correlated with island area, maximum elevation, and distance from source. 5) The claimed positive correlation between species range and genus size, even if it should be shown to exist, is probably insufficient to account for the magnitude of these deviations. 6) The main causes of the excess of insular S/G's over those predicted by chance are probably two simultaneous tendencies: a) similarity of congeneric species in ecological requirements. b) similarity of congeneric species in dispersal capabilities.
