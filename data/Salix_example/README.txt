>> cooccur_interact_galler_parasit.csv <<

List of all possible galler-parasitoid combinations and the number of times they cooccur and interact.
Data from the Kopelke dataset
Built from ../../code/calculating_n_and_k.R

>> coccur_interact_galler_salix.csv <<

List of all possible galler-salix combinations and the number of times they cooccur and interact.
Data from the Kopelke dataset
Built from ../../code/calculating_n_and_k.R


>> galler_para_heatmap_abs <<

A matrix of galler and parasitoid interactions. Positive values are the number of times species
interact, while negative values are the number of times species which never interact cooccur.
For making a heatmap of how certain we are that interactions really don't exist.
Could also have percentage of times species interact when they cooccur as positive numbers instead of 
just number of times they interact.
Data from Kopelke dataset.
Built from ../../code/build_n_k_matrix.R


>> galler_salix_heatmap_abs.csv <<

Same as >> galler_para_heatmap_abs << but for galler-salix interactions.
Data from Kopelke dataset.
Built from ../../code/build_n_k_matrix.R
